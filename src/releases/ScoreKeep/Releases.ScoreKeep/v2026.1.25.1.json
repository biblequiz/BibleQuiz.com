  "body": "Fixed a bug occurring if the following conditions are met:\r\n1. Questions have already been imported.\r\n2. There are more imported questions than matches (e.g., 9 sets of questions and only 7 rounds in the meet).\r\n3. Starting Round is greater than 1 for a meet (e.g., 2).\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, ScoreKeep will shift forward the set of questions. For example, if the starting round is 3, the third match from the imported questions will be used for the first match (fourth for the second match, etc.). Importing the questions again won't fix it either without restarting ScoreKeep.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been addressed in this release."
