In today’s day and age, teenagers face a multitude of influences that are all vying for their undivided attention. Social media, television and movies, and popular culture are just a few of these influences that can be incredibly persuasive for an impressionable teen. As these ever-changing, worldly influences have increased, so also has the necessity of engaging and innovative teen Bible studies that can not only hold the attention of modern teenagers, but also feed them the immutable truth found within the Bible. An effective teen Bible study can provide budding adults with an environment for them to learn and grow spiritually, discuss difficult topics and situations they might face in their day to day lives, and create lasting relationships that will aid them in enduring future trials.

When preparing to lead a teen Bible study, one must put considerable effort into the topics that will be discussed and how they are presented. To make a lasting impact on the hearts and minds of teenagers, meaningful topics must be chosen and presented in a way that encourages debate and inquiry. Choosing a topic may seem daunting, but this article will outline a few great ones that will lay the groundwork for life-changing interactions and discussions in any teen Bible study.

## Identity

The first important topic to consider for a teenage Bible study is the concept of identity. Questions like "Who am I?," "What was I created for?," and "What is my purpose?" can be incredibly overwhelming for people of all ages, but especially for teenagers. If a teen does not have a solid answer to these questions, they can be susceptible to seeking for an identity in all the wrong places. For a teenager to develop into a stable and mature adult, they must be confident in their identity. Luckily, the Bible speaks about our identity in Christ often.

Passages like 1 Peter 2:9 and Ephesians 2:10

> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. (1 Pet 2:9)

> For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. (Eph 2:10)

are perfect starting points for building a constructive and powerful teen Bible study that focuses on the identity that God has given His people. These verses also emphasize the extreme value that God places on His children, which can be encouraging for teenagers who face bullying or self-esteem issues. When speaking on this topic, it can be eye-opening to have students write down words or phrases that express who the world says they are, then read these passages, and finally, have the students write down who God says they are based on what they read.

## Relationships

Second, consider formulating a teen Bible study on relationships to help students explore principles like love, kindness, forgiveness, and faithfulness, all of which are discussed throughout countless scriptures. A key facet of one’s teenage years is developing meaningful friendships and romantic partnerships, and deciding which people they should trust and which they should keep at arm’s length. Developing relationship skills is imperative, then, for teenagers to avoid turmoil as they get older.

Scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 13, Proverbs 17:17, and Ephesians 4:2-3

> If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. ... (1 Cor 13:1)

> A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity. (Prov 17:17)

> Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. (Eph 4:2-3)

can help teenagers understand respect, loyalty, and empathy within their relationships with friends and family. Additionally, passages like Ephesians 5:22-33, 1 Corinthians 6:12-20, and Colossians 3:18-19 can illuminate sensitive topics like sexual purity and marriage. A helpful way to present these topics is to have students share a few of their relationship experiences, whether they are positive or negative, then read some of these passages, and lastly, have the students compare their experiences to what the Bible says. This is a great way to challenge teenagers to examine themselves and come up with a plan to improve their relationships in the future.

## Mental Health

Third, as more teenagers struggle with mental health issues, it is imperative that a Bible study group take this topic head-on and open conversations about how prayer, meditation, and seeking wise counsel from friends, family, and church members can help teenagers effectively cope with these struggles. There is a large stigma that surrounds the idea of mental health, which can make it intimidating for students to share their experiences. This is why providing a comforting and safe space for teenagers to be honest is so important.

Scripture offers comfort and direction to those struggling with anxiety, depression, or any other form of mental illness in passages such as Psalm 34:18, Matthew 11:28, and 1 Peter 5:7:

> The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. (Ps 34:18)

> Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. (Matt 11:28)

> Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. (1 Pet 5:7)

These verses all emphasize God's love, care, and desire to help His children. Discussions over this topic can include practical ways to combat anxiety attacks and what to do when depressing thoughts seem to overwhelm the mind.

## Faith in Action

Fourth, due to social media, it has become very easy for a teenager’s self-image to become a god in their lives. They have become increasingly aware of how others view them, their actions, and their speech. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the significance of turning their faith into action. Leading a teenage Bible study that focuses on this topic can help lead students to a deeper connection and appreciation for their faith, as well as an improved relationship with God.

Passages like James 2:14-26, Matthew 25:31-46, and 1 John 3:17-18 can expound on the ideas of being a servant to others and sharing God’s love through words and actions.

> What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?... (James 2:14)

> When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.... (Matt 25:31-33)

> If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. (1 John 3:17-18)

These verses can help inspire students to become the hands and feet of Jesus. A practical way to share this topic with students is to involve them in service initiatives, small missions trips, or volunteering activities. Such experiences can be life-changing for teenagers by allowing them to fulfill Christ’s command to, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation."

Another way to incorporate the topic of "Faith in Action" is to involve students in a ministry known as [Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz), or [TBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com). [TBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com) is a Christian ministry that gives teens all over America the opportunity to memorize entire books of the Bible alongside peers in their church, and then challenge other teams in a Jeopardy-style competition. Although [TBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com) involves memorization and skill in answering scripture-based questions, the heart behind the ministry is that students would learn to turn their faith into action. Teenagers involved in this ministry are encouraged to earn what is called a "Discipleship Award." This award requires that students not only memorize the scripture and read study guides, but also that they take actionable steps like tithing, speaking with missionaries, or volunteering at a local shelter. In this way, [TBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com) is the perfect avenue to get students excited about their faith and the many opportunities they will have to live that faith out.

## Coping With Peer Pressure and Temptation

Lastly, peer pressure and temptation are enormous struggles for teenagers all over the world. It would be incredibly beneficial to develop a teen Bible study that addresses how to face peer pressure and the temptation to conform to societal norms that do not coincide with biblical values. Teenagers may face challenges related to drug and alcohol abuse, dishonesty, sexual immorality, or any number of temptations that will attempt to compromise their values or integrity. Giving teenagers the tools to face these pressures without hesitation is a great way to ensure that they do not sway from their faith in Christ.

Verses like 1 Corinthians 10:13, James 1:12-15, or Ephesians 6:10-18 can offer guidance in how to resist these threats to their faith by leaning on Christ’s strength as their firm foundation.

> No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it. (1 Cor 10:13)

> ...When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.... (James 1:13-14)

> Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.... (Eph 6:10-11)

A helpful way to review this topic is to set students up with an accountability partner. If they do not feel comfortable sharing their temptations with an entire group, they can share their struggles with one individual who they trust and who understands what they are going through. This accountability partner can help them come up with ways to resist their temptations, as well as encourage them to keep trying if they fail.

Today’s young people face many unique difficulties during their teenage years that are magnified by our current culture and societal climate. By covering topics like identity, relationships, mental health, faith in action, and peer pressure and temptation management, any teen Bible study can have the opportunity to offer invaluable support in helping students navigate such difficult waters with success. By exploring these themes in a safe environment with like-minded peers, teenagers can form connections while finding guidance and encouragement to grow spiritually, which will ultimately lead to an unshakable faith that they can continue to lean upon for the rest of their lives.
