The teenage years can be difficult in many ways. Dealing with struggles with identity, self-worth, peer pressure and relationship difficulties can leave teenagers feeling adrift, lost and alone. The Bible offers comfort in these difficult years by offering words of wisdom, strength, encouragement and guidance helping teens to live fulfilling and meaningful lives. Knowing the scriptures and meditating on them help teens keep the proper outlook on life and help them not only to survive but to thrive. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 states:

> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

Teenagers frequently struggle with peer influences and an immense pressure to conform and join in, fulfilling expectations set forth by others, but the Bible warns about following the crowd. Examples include Romans 12:2 and Galatians 1:10:

> Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

> Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.

Ministries like [Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz.com) help teenagers to form relationships with like-minded teenagers who are studying chapters and books of the Bible and learning to follow the Lord’s leading in their lives.

Teenagers can also struggle with self-esteem and with accepting themselves for who they are. The Bible addresses this in several passages and encourages teens to realize that they are precious and valuable in God’s sight. Rather than compare themselves with others or dwell on perceived flaws they should instead find peace knowing God created each person uniquely for His purposes. Psalm 139:14 and 1 Timothy 4:12 can encourage teens:

> I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.

> Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.

Adolescence can be an emotionally trying time for many; emotions may run high in response to different situations. But, God, through the scripture, provides a way to deal with heightened emotions. Ephesians 4:22-27 are some of those scriptures:

> You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body. "In your anger do not sin": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.

Being part of a small group can provide fellowship and support during hard times and give support when life is difficult. Memorizing scriptures in a ministry like [Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz.com) gives teens the tools they need when they are feeling overwhelmed.

Expressions of sexuality and the temptations to participate in inappropriate activities are common issues for teens. Although social values often shift quickly, the Bible remains consistent on sexual purity. 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 share our Lord's foundation in this area:

> Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.

But teens need community to support and reinforce Biblical values and lifestyle choices. The support of a small group or a mentor help teens to take the knowledge of the scripture from the head to the heart. Consistent involvement in a Bible based group like [Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz.com) can provide this framework.

Worries and anxieties associated with teenage life can seem overwhelming at times. Teens may experience stress related to schoolwork, family, finances, relationships and the future. The world makes it easy to fall into a state of perpetual anxiety and fear, but the word of God provides a way out. See Philippians 4:6-8:

> Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.

By placing their anxieties into God's hands, turning their worries into prayers, teens can stop living a life of anxiety and fear. Knowing the scripture and thinking on the things of God is essential for living the kind of life that God intends.

The Bible provides wisdom and advice for every challenge that teenagers experience. By studying and memorizing the word of God, teenagers can hide God’s word in their hearts. Consider Psalm 119:11 and Proverbs 3:5-6:

> I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.

> Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

Teenagers do best when they study and memorize the word with others. Small groups that provide fellowship and structured Bible study are great helps. A discipleship ministry like [Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz.com) can help teens grow in the Lord through the study of whole chapters of the Bible in a fun, competitive environment. The scripture learned as a teenager, that which they hide in their hearts, will be a great resource for faith for a lifetime.
