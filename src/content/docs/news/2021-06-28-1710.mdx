ST. LOUIS — Monday's preliminary rounds are now complete at the 2021 AG Teen Bible Quiz National Finals, and 20 teams will move up to Championship Division play beginning Tuesday morning.

Playoff games were required to break a two-way tie for fourth place in Group A, and a pair of playoffs were needed to break a four-way tie for third, with the winners of each of those matches advancing to the Championship Division.

{/* excerpt */}

The top four teams in each group advance, while the remainder will play in the Challenger Division.

On Tuesday, the main round robin draw begins at 9:45 a.m. CT. Five rounds will be played in the morning session, and four more rounds in the afternoon session. Nineteen rounds in total will be played to determine the winners.

Here are the final results from each of Monday's five groups. Except as indicated by playoff results, two-way ties are broken by head-to-head results, three-way ties or more are broken by total points.
