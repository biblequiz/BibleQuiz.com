Many people say that the Bible is just a book of wise sayings and practices that can help someone live a good life, while others insist that it is simply a history book for scholars to mull over. However, to Christians, the Bible is God’s Word that was given to chosen individuals to write down long ago. The Bible illuminates God’s character, ways, and will and allows us to learn about His unending, unconditional love for His people, despite their sin and disobedience. As Hebrews 4:12 states, 

>"For the Word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart." 

{/* excerpt */}

Although the Bible is thousands of years old, it is relevant for all people, throughout all time. It speaks to individuals living now and it explains God’s plan to redeem humanity from their sin and give them eternal life with Him. 

Understanding the Bible and how its 66 books work together to tell the story of our sin, God’s love, and our salvation, therefore, is an incredibly important aspect of being a Christian. One way to embark on this journey is to memorize the books of the Bible and their main teachings. Now, memorizing books of the Bible may seem like a daunting task, but its benefits can prove invaluable when it comes to understanding and referring to God's word. Memorization does not only benefit scholars or pastors who wish to deepen their knowledge, but everyday Christian believers who just want to gain a holistic understanding of the Bible as well. Here we provide tips and tricks for memorizing the books of the Bible successfully and with confidence.

## Create Familiarity

The first step to memorizing books of the Bible is to familiarize yourself with them. Read through your Bible or review a list of the books so you are familiar with each name and order they occur in, noting if some books share similar titles, like 1 and 2 Kings or 1, 2, and 3 John. This can help you in the future when making connections and remembering their order. You should also take note of the fact that the Bible itself is split into two parts: the Old Testament, which contains 39 books, and the New Testament, which contains 27 books. It makes sense to focus on one of these sections at a time, keeping in mind that historically, the Old Testament comes before the New Testament.

Another way to get familiar with the books of the Bible is to research their main teachings and writing styles, who wrote them, and who they were written to. This will help you tremendously when it comes to gaining an understanding of how the Bible’s books work together to tell one story. It will also help you to split the books into sections appropriately to aid in memorization, which we will discuss next. 

## Split the Task into Components

One effective approach for memorizing the books of the Bible is breaking them up into smaller segments. Luckily, the books of the Bible are already put in order based on categories, such as history, poetry, and prophecy. Researching the different categories and which books fall into those categories will help you to create smaller, more manageable chunks for you to memorize. Doing this will help you to absorb not only the name of each book, but also some information about each book, which will deepen your understanding of the Bible as a whole. Additionally, this will make recalling all the books together much easier.

## Utilize Acronyms, Mnemonic Devices and Songs

Another effective technique for memory is using acronyms, mnemonic devices, and songs as aids for recalling information. Many find it useful to create acronyms for each group of books. For example, the first five books of the Bible, also known as the books of Law, are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. An acronym for these five books would be "GELND." Creating acronyms such as this one for each group of books that you are memorizing can aid in your ability to recall them quickly.

Creating mnemonic devices to assist in remembering the order of books is also helpful. Mnemonic devices can include phrases, sentences or even rhymes which make it easier and more fun to memorize efficiently and recall information effectively. For instance, using the first five books of the Bible again, a mnemonic device for these books could be "Great Elephants Love Napping Daily." Or, for Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, a mnemonic device could be "General Electric Power Company." 

Songs can also be an extremely effective tool when it comes to memorizing lists, including memorizing the books of the Bible. Find an enjoyable tune and use its melody as the base to create a song that lists out the books of the Bible in order, or perhaps even alphabetically. If you’re not the creative type, you can always go online to find premade songs that you can memorize. One of the biggest benefits to utilizing songs for memorization is that you will find yourself singing the tune often, which will help you to memorize quickly. 

## Try Visualization Techniques and Repetition

Visualization can play an essential part in helping to strengthen your memory of the books of the Bible. One powerful visualization technique, called the Memory Palace technique, involves mentally walking yourself through familiar places - like your home or a favorite spot - associating each book with specific objects or rooms so you have cues that help retrieve that knowledge when necessary. Additionally, if you have a basic idea of what each book of the Bible is about, you can visualize the events and stories of each book as you memorize them, which will help you to associate the events of each book with their name.

Repetition is also vital when it comes to memorizing. The more often you practice reciting Bible books aloud or writing their names down on flashcards, the faster your memory will retain the material. Reviewing mental lists regularly while reciting names aloud can make an impressive difference in retention levels. There are also plenty of apps that you can use to create flashcards or quizzes to help you practice what you are memorizing regularly. 

## Go Even Further

Memorizing the names of the 66 books of the Bible is an impressive feat that takes hard work and dedication, but there are further steps you can take to deepen your relationship with God and your understanding of His Word. Do not allow your knowledge of the Bible to rest at the surface level. Begin using these techniques to memorize verses, chapters, and even whole books of the Bible. Find what works for you and use it to strengthen your memory and get closer to your God and Savior. There are many groups and ministries to get involved in that encourage this type of memorization, one of which is called [Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz). 

[Teen Bible Quiz](https://www.biblequiz), or [TBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com), is a ministry that encourages pre-teens and teens across America to memorize entire books of the Bible and then quiz against other teens in their area in a Jeopardy-style game. This ministry pushes students to their full potential, teaches them useful memorization techniques like those described above, gives them countless opportunities to build relationships, instills leadership and teamwork skills, and encourages them to dive deep into the Word of God. Not only so, but it allows students to be rewarded for their dedication to memorizing God’s Word through scholarships and awards. 

In conclusion, memorizing books of the Bible may initially seem difficult, but with the proper approaches and techniques it can become manageable. By breaking down the information into smaller groups and employing memory aids such as songs or mnemonic devices to commit books to memory, over time, you can build up to complete mastery over multiple books. After accomplishing such an impressive task, push yourself even further and create new goals which encourage you to memorize more of God’s Word. As God says in Isaiah 55:11 

>"… so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it."

Committing God’s Word to memory and hiding it within your heart with the right attitude will never return void but will continue to bless you throughout your entire life.
