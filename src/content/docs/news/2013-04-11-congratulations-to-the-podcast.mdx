Tim McDaniel has accomplished a remarkable feat. Yesterday he recorded his 200th edition of the Bible Quiz Podcast. Keeping a free resource like that regularly available is no easy task, so he deserves a lot of respect. I'd encourage everyone to check out the podcast, listen to the 200th show, and take some time to check out the archives.

There are a lot of great shows, and there are some that include me, but don't hold that against Tim. The podcast is a labor of love, and Tim has done an amazing job and I am glad to have had a front row seat for the ride.
