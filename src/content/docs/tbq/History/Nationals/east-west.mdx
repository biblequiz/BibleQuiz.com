_\* Boys were winning 75 to 15 on question number 11. The quizmaster inadvertently asked a 60 point question and the girls answered it tying the game on Question # 12 and forcing an overtime game. The boys interrupted the question and answered it incorrectly. The reread question was answered by the girls for a final score of 85 to 70._
