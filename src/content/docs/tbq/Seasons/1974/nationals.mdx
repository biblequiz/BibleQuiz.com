The 12th National Bible Quiz Finals took place in the summer of 1974 in Springfield, Missouri at Central Assembly of God covering the books of I and II Thessalonians, I and II Peter. James. H.H. "Spud" DeMent was the National Coordinator.

The event was won by Brookfield A/G, Brookfield, MO (pictured). The second place team was from the Great Lakes region, but we do not know the name of the church.

The top scorer at the 1974 National Finals was Jesse Hykes of First A/G, Elizabeth, NJ.

We know nearly nothing about this event.
