The 26th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 10-12, 1988 in Springfield, Missouri at Central Assembly of God covering the books of Hebrews and I and II Peter. Barry Kolanowski was the National Coordinator and John Wootton was the official question writer.

The event was won by Eastside A/G, Tucson, AZ (pictured). The second place team was Central A/G, Springfield, MO.

The team from Eastside A/G, Tucson, AZ became the third consecutive National Champion from the state of Arizona following the victories by First A/G Tempe, AZ in 1986 and 1987. Tuscon had been the runner-up the previous year and had defeated Central A/G, Springfield, MO in the playoff for second place. This year there was no playoff although Central A/G, Springfield, MO was able to defeat Tuscon in the round-robin.

1988 marked the first time that two teams representing a single church competed in the National Finals. These teams were from Carpenter's Home Church, Lakeland, FL, the same church which would win consecutive National championships in 1990 and 1991. The Great Lakes region was perhaps the toughest this year as First Christian A/G, Cincinnati, OH and Trinity Christian Church, Hudson, OH, both of Ohio, finished 3rd and 4th respectively.

The top scorer at the 1988 National Finals was Marcae Johnson of Central A/G, Springfield, MO. Marcae also won the individual one-on-one tournament by defeating David Lowe of Evangel A/G, Wichita, KS. This marked the first time that a quizzer had won both the top scorer trophy and the individual tournament.
