## What is Adult Bible Quiz?

Adult Bible Quiz is a fun way to raise money for Teen Bible Quiz: The quizzers become coaches and officials, while everyone else has to quiz! Teams are split into divisions of experienced quizzers and rookies. So if you've never sat at the table before or haven't memorized a verse, join the Fun Division and and prepare to have a great time!

Contact [Patti Smith](mailto:p.s.momof5@gmail.com) with any questions.
