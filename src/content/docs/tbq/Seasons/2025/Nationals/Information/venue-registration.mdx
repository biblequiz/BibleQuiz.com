:::caution[Do not Overbook Your Hotel Rooms]
A few churches have had multiple people book the same rooms. The last time we were in St. Louis, several teams cancelled rooms the week before, and it causes issues for teams. Please book *only* the exact number of rooms needed. As of 3 PM today, we have gone way over on our contract for rooms. June 2 is the absolute deadline. Contact [Pastor Bernie Elliot](pastorbernie@biblequiz.com) if you have any challenges booking.
