## Discord

Communication at National Finals will be done through a free app called [Discord](http://discord.com).

Here are just a few of the things we will be using Discord for:

* General announcements, like last-minute room changes
* Quoting bee and individual tournament room assignments
* Scheduling officials each day
* Finding rides to the airport or to a restaurant
* Finding teammates for Adult Bible Quiz

Discord is the platform where you will find the latest announcements and news throughout the week. Plus, it is also a great place to connect with the community by finding rides to/from the airport, setting up a time for fellowship in the lobbies, scheduling your team photos, and much more.
