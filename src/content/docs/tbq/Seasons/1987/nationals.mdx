The 25th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 3-5, 1987 in Oklahoma City, OK at Faith Tabernacle covering the book of John. Barry Kolanowski was the National Coordinator and Paul Freitag was the official question writer.

The event was won by First A/G, Tempe, AZ for the second consecutive year (pictured). The second place team was Eastside A/G, Tucson, AZ.

In claiming their second consecutive National Finals victory, the team from First A/G, Tempe, AZ became the third team to accomplish this feat. The others were Full Gospel Chapel, Denver, CO in 1966-67, and First A/G, New Orleans, LA in 1983-84. Carpenters Home Church, Lakeland, FL would also win consecutive championships in 1990-91. Coupled with their first place victory in 1986 and their second place finish in 1985, Tempe became the most dominant team in any three year period.

The battle for second place was extremely hard fought. At the end of round-robin, four teams were tied for first place and the teams engaged in a two-game playoff after being seeded by total points. Eastside A/G, Tucson, AZ, the team with the most points, defeated Christian Life Center, Farmington, MN in one playoff. The match between the two middle seeds saw Central A/G, Springfield, MO defeat the team from Evangel A/G, Wichita, KS. Tucson then defeated Springfield to claim the second place trophy. Ironically, at next year's finals, Tucson would win first place while Springfield would finish second.

1987 marked the first time that two teams representing the same region finished in the top two spots at Nationals. Arizona and the Southwest region were in the midst of a four-year stranglehold on the top spot as they won from 1986-1989.

The top scorer at the 1987 National Finals was Tammy Yost of First A/G, Branford, CT. David Lowe of Evangel A/G, Wichita, KS was second and Marcae Johnson of Central A/G, Springfield, MO was third. Jason Picker of Eastside A/G, Tucson, AZ won the individual tournament.
