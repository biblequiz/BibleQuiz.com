At the end of Luke, the district only had 2 eligible teams in the A Division. Santa Ana combined their teams into one and Corona is a Friends Church.
We do have three other divisions, but none of them move on to Regional Finals. However, Santa Ana and Orange Hills battled it out for first and second.
