First Place went to the team from Pine City, Minnesota with 5 wins and zero losses.  This was the first state title for Pine City.
Congratulations Pine City.  Second Place went to the team from Bethel Assembly in Minneapolis with a record of 4 wins and one loss.
Bethel has competed in Regionals and National finals before, but it has been since 1984 -- a long stretch.
