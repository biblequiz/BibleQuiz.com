31 teams competed in the tournament. The questions were written at a Regional Level, and the competition was fierce. After 8 seeding rounds, teams were ranked and placed into 4 Divisions of 8 teams each.
In order to win the tournament, a team must win the three-game, sudden-death playoff. Las Vegas was low-scoring in the morning rounds, but their experience helped them to
come on strong to challenge Orange Hills in the final, winner-takes-all Championship Game.
