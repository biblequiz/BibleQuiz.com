The 4th National Bible Quiz Finals took place in the summer of 1966 in Springfield, Missouri at Central A/G covering the book of Romans. Russell J. Cox was the National Coordinator and G. Raymond Carlson was the official question writer.

The event was won by Full Gospel Chapel, Denver, CO. They also won the following year. The second place team was West Side Gospel Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN.

This was the first national finals in which a full round-robin was played. In years prior, the eight teams competed in a single-elimination tournament.

While the complete list of participants, is known, we do not possess any of the round by round information. Of course, top scorers were not officially announced until 1968 so information on this will be difficult to obtain.
