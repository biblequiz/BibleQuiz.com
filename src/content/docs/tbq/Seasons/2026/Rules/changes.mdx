Practically, there aren't many significant changes to the rules for the 2025-2026 season. Notable changes are below:

We've removed the "General Information" from the main text of the Bible Quiz Rules. The majority of those rules are now available on BibleQuiz.com in the [Competition Structure and Eligibility section](./eligibility). Since these rules primarily apply only to DBQCs and new churches, it made sense to remove them from the rules that teams carry from round to round.

We've adjusted our eligibility rules to more closely mirror those of Fine Arts. This change serves a few purposes:

1. Brings more cohesion across A/G-sponsored youth ministries
2. Closes long-open loopholes to prevent "super senior" issues
3. Permits increased eligibility for particularly high-achieving students who graduate traditional high school early

We've removed the individual foul for incorrect hand placement when seated at the quiz table. Instruction for proper hand placement still remains, and fouls are still applicable for help and improper communication (gesturing, hand signals, etc.).

We've made minor wording changes throughout the document to enhance flow and clarify potentially confusing items.
