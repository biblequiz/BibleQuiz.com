The 6th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 19-20, 1968 in Springfield, Missouri at Central Bible College covering the books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1,2 Timothy, and Titus. Norman Correll was the National Coordinator.

The event was won by Bethel A/G, Arlington, TX with a 6-1 record. The second place team was Columbia A/G, Columbia, IL.

This was the only year which covered the books mentioned above. Also, 1968 marked the first time that a high scorer was officially announced. That honor went to Judy Purcell of Columbia A/G, Columbia, IL. Second high scorer went to Claudette Dacus of Full Gospel Chapel, Denver, CO. Claudette was a member of the team which won Nationals the previous year (1967) and she also participated with the same church in the 1970 National Finals.

All of the participants are known and we also have pictures of all of the teams. The round by round schedule is also known, however, none of the scores for the rounds are known.
