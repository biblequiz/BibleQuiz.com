The 1st National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 23-24, 1963 at First A/G in Memphis, Tennessee
covering the book of Luke. Lee Schultz was the [National Coordinator](/tbq/history/general/coordinators/) and Stan Walters was the [official question writer](/tbq/history/general/question-writers/).

The event was won by [Bouldercrest A/G, Atlanta, GA](#southeast-region). The second place team was [First A/G, Plainview, TX](#south-central-region).

The team from [Bouldercrest A/G, Atlanta, GA](#southeast-region) later moved to Decatur, GA where they
won two more Nationals in 1976 and 1978 for a total of 3 National Championships, a record which was duplicated by
First A/G, New Orleans, LA ('71, '83 and '84) and Orange Hills A/G, Orange, CA ('99, '02 and '03).  The record was broken by The Church at Briargate,
Colorado Springs, CO when they won their fourth championship ('01, '04, '06 and '07).
 This same church moved again to Centerville, GA where even
today they have a Bible Quiz team.

The first National Bible Quiz Finals was a single elimination tournament with the first place teams from
the eight regions participating. The single elimination format was used for the first three years of the
event. In addition, the championship match was played in the evening in front of 7,000 General Council
attendees! Now what teams out there would like to have a single elimination format and then a final in front
of a crowd like that?!

Complete records for this event are available on this site. However, we only have the scores of the rounds
involving the championship team although we do know the competitors and results of each round. Therefore,
if you have any additional information related to this please e-mail
[hello@biblequiz.com](mailto:hello@biblequiz.com).

Please read a personal account of the first National Bible Quiz Finals 
by [Scott Laurens](/tbq/seasons/1963/memories/scott-laurens), captain and top scorer of the first place team.

### Individuals

The first National Bible Quiz Tournament in 1963 did not announce the top quizzers. The tournament was single elimination meaning that the maximum number of quizzes a team could play was 3. Therefore, it is difficult to determine who was the top quizzer. In the final quiz for first place, [Scott Laurens](/tbq/seasons/1963/memories/scott-laurens) of [Bouldercrest A/G, Atlanta, GA](#southeast-region), who had been the top scorer on his team in the previous two rounds, was the top quizzer as his team won the tournament.
