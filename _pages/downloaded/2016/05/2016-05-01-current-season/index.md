## Corrections

**Scripture Portion:**

1. Error in 1 Timothy 3:12. There should not be the word “his” before household.” Please delete it.
2. Please note Crete in Titus 1:5 is not in “Italics”- It should be. It is listed as such in the CA, and the new Entire CA. It also italicized in vs 12.

**Application question**:

Question number 5 for 20 points. Scripture-text application question.  
What does Paul mean by the statement, **Quote** “Night and day we toiled to earn a living so that we would not be a burden to any of you”?  
1 Th 2:9   Other traveling ministers sometimes demanded free food and lodging, but Paul didn’t want to give any hindrance to his ministry. Bruce, 35

The word “**Quote**” is missing in the Application Question.
