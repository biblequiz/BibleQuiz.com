> The following changes will be in effect starting with the 2022-2023 season over I & II Thessalonians, I & II Timothy, Titus, and I, II, & III John.

## **1\. Remove the Reference Question**

For many years, the Reference Question has been problematic for a [number of reasons]({% link _pages/why-the-reference-question-is-changing.md %}). To solve these problems, we've removed the Reference Question introductory remark in favor of a new introductory remark that gives information about the _location_ of the answers instead of the _question_.

This new introductory remark will simply say “from consecutive verses” or “from separate verses" if a question has an answer from multiple verses. This information is given to the quizzers in the **_location_** part of the introductory remark.

The vast majority of the questions asked in a season demand answers from a single verse, so this only impacts a small percentage of questions over the course of the entire season.

And towards the end of the season, it will always be clear to everyone—officials, parents, coaches, and most importantly, quizzers— that the answer will come from multiple verses. **_This will be clear regardless of how many parts there are to the question._**

## 2\. **Add “From separate verses” introductory remark**

This operates just like the "From consecutive verses" introductory remark we're used to hearing in many Give a Complete Answer questions except that the answers come from _multiple, non-consecutive_ verses.

Here is an example of how this question has been asked previously.

> **30 points. Give 4 complete answers. From Hebrews chapter 12.**  
According to separate verses, let us do what?  
> \[H 12:1\] Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,  
> \[H 12:28\] Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,

And here is how it will be asked now.

> **30 points. Give 4 complete answers. From 2 separate verses of Hebrews chapter 12.**  
Let us do what?

"From separate verses" will be used for other types of questions as well.

> **20 points. 2-part chapter analysis answer. From separate verses of Hebrews chapter 5.**  
Which individuals are named?  
\[H 5:4\] Aaron  
\[H 5:6\] Melchizedek

### What happens if some of the verses are consecutive?

Suppose the required answer comes from verses 1, 2, 3, and 5 of a chapter. The question will be labeled "From separate verses."

Even though verses 1-3 happen to be consecutive, the **entirety of the answer** is not from consecutive verses. Therefore, it is labeled "From separate verses."

See [page 25 of the Bible Quiz Rules]({% link assets/2022/22-23-BQ-Rules.pdf %}) for the complete list of rules pertaining to this introductory remark.

## **3\. Simplify the syntax of introductory remarks**

The introductory remarks can be broken down into four parts:

1. The question number and value (Question number 1 for 10 points.)
2. Question type (Quotation question, 2-part question, etc.)
3. Answer type (Give a complete answer, Chapter analysis answer, etc.)
4. Answer location (From Mark chapter 1.)

As we worked on the rules for requiring answers from consecutive or separate verses, we had to figure out how to insert "From consecutive verses" or "From separate verses" into the introductory remarks even if it's not a Give a Complete Answer.

We adjusted the syntax so #3 tells you what _kind_ of answer to give: Chapter analysis answer, Give a complete answer, two-part answer, etc.

#4 tells you if the answer comes from consecutive or separate verses as well as _where_ to find the answers.

> **20 points. 2-part question. Give a complete answer from 2 consecutive verses. From First Peter chapter 2.**  
Like newborn babies, what should you do, and why?

> **20 points. 2-part question. Give a complete answer. From 2 consecutive verses of First Peter chapter 2.**  
Like newborn babies, what should you do, and why?

In testing, quizzers picked up on this very quickly, and we have received a lot of positive feedback on the introductory remarks having a better flow. You will see this syntax used in all of the examples.
