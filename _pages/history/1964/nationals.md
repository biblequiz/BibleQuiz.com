The 2nd National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 17-21, 1964 in Springfield, MO covering the books of 1,2 Corinthians. Donald F. Johns was the official question writer.

The event was won by Burlington A/G, Burlington, NC marking the second consecutive year the Southeast won the championship. The second place team was East Gary A/G, East Gary, IN.

We have nearly complete results from this even as well as pictures of almost all matches and all teams. We are missing some small data items like who coached some of the teams. We also have one recollection written by [Joyce Lufkin]({% link _pages/history/1964/memories/joyce-lufkin.md %}) from Winthrop, WA.

### Individuals

The second National Bible Quiz Tournament in 1964 did not announce the top quizzers. The tournament was single elimination meaning that the maximum number of quizzes a team could play was 3. Therefore, it is difficult to determine who was the top quizzer. James Johnson of [Burlington A/G, Burlington, NC](#southeast-region), was the captain and top scorer of the team which won the tournament.
