The 20th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 11-13, 1982 in Springfield, Missouri at Central Assembly of God covering the books of I,II Thessalonians, I,II Peter, and James. Terry Carter was the National Coordinator.

The event was won by First A/G, Tecumseh, OK. The second place team was Evangel Temple, A/G, Decatur, GA.

The team from First A/G, Tecumseh, OK became the first team to win from the South Central region since Bethel A/G, Arlington, TX won in 1968 and would be the last team from that region to win until 1998. Tecumseh completely reversed their fortunes at Nationals since they had not won a match during the 1981 finals. The victory was extremely hard fought and came down to the final quiz, indeed the final question versus Evangel Temple, A/G, Decatur, GA for the championship. Before that final round, Tecumseh's only loss came in the first round against Trinity A/G, Lanham, MD. After this, they won 6 straight matches to claim the first place trophy. Decatur set a record at the time for points scored with a 192 average, but it was not enough to overcome Tecumseh in the final quiz.

The top quizzer at the 1982 National Finals was Ken Henderson of First A/G, Tecumseh, OK. Ken achieved this feat in the final quiz by answering the last question which not only gave his team the victory, but also gave him the high scorer trophy over Rhett Laurens of Evangel Temple, A/G, Decatur, GA who finished second. Rhett completed his quizzing career having finished among the top six scorers 4 times, including a first place finish in 1979. Finishing third in the top quizzer race was a young man named Paul Freitag of Bethel A/G, Minneapolis, MN. Paul still helps coordinate national finals.
