_Updated for the 2024-2025 Season_

Tie-breaker rules will not apply for all team positions that do not qualify to advance in official competition at Leagues, Districts, Regionals, or Nationals. Some larger districts may require additional elimination competitions, such as semi-finals, which are also considered official competition. Tie-breakers may also be used to determine placement for trophies, awards, etc.

For ties in official competition, the Official Competition Tie-breaker Rules must be used (except for the Championship and Challenger brackets at National Finals, see "Special National Finals Tie-breaker Rules" below), and all the teams involved in the tie will be ranked by points scored (if identical, then the "head-to-head" results between just the teams with identical points scored will determine the higher rank).

-   For ties in the Preliminary Brackets at National Finals, the Official Competition Tie-breaker Rules must be used.
-   For any unofficial competition, the coordinator will determine and announce what tie-breakers will be used for that quizzing event.

To determine what tie-breaker to use, first determine how many positions are open for advancement from the place (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.) in which the teams are tied for. Then follow the tie-breaker rules for the number of teams involved in the tie.
