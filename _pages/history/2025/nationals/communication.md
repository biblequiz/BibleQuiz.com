## Discord

Communication at National Finals will be done through a free app called Discord.

Discord is the platform where you will find the latest announcements and news throughout the week. Plus, it is also a great place to connect with the community by finding rides to/from the airport, setting up a time for fellowship in the lobbies, scheduling your team photos, and much more.

Complete instructions on how to get setup and running with Discord is [available here]({% link _pages/discord.md %}).
