_⚠️ Please do not overbook your hotel rooms. A few churches have had multiple people book the same rooms. The last time we were in St. Louis, several teams cancelled rooms the week before, and it causes issues for teams. Please only book the exact rooms needed. As of 3 PM today, we have gone way over on our contract for rooms. June 2 is the absolute deadline, but I would take care of it ASAP. Contact [Pastor Bernie Elliot](pastorbernie@biblequiz.com) if you have any challenges booking._

<!-- NOTE: The deadline to get the discounted rate for the hotel is **Tuesday, May 28, 2024**. -->
