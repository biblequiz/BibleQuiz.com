## What is the Individual Tournament?

No teams, no coaches; quizzers compete on-their-own in a rapid-fire round! Each room has four quizzers, but only two advance.

Top 3 quizzers who advance to the final round receive scholarships to the school of their choice:

1st Place: $650  
2nd Place: $250  
3rd Place: $100

## Quizzer Eligibility and Placement

1. Forty-four quizzers from the Championship bracket and twenty quizzers from the Challenger bracket may compete.
2. All quizzers receive a seeding number to be posted following team quizzing.
3. The tournament consists of five rounds with four quizzers competing at one time in each room. The top two advance each round until the final.
4. For round one, quizzers will use their seeding number and the format in the National Finals Program to determine their starting room.
5. Round one begins at the announced time and will not be delayed for late quizzers.
6. Quizmasters must verify that the correct quizzers are present for each round.

## Match Structure

1. Each round consists of twelve questions: four 10-point, five 20-point, and three 30-point questions.
2. The score will be read after questions 5, 7, 9, and 11. A quizzer will be notified when they have four correct or two incorrect. Failure to read the score or notify a quizzer is not contestable.
3. No coaches or time-outs are permitted.
4. Any interrupted question answered incorrectly will be reread once for the remaining quizzers. If the reread question is interrupted and missed, it will be read in its entirety for contesting purposes only.
5. Only a quizzer ruled incorrect may contest, but any quizzer may contest validity. No responses are permitted. Once the Judges have ruled on the validity of a question, no further validity contests may be presented on that question.
6. If a tie occurs, the following rules apply:
 <ol type="a">
   <li>A two-way tie for second will be broken by the normal tie-breaking rules.</li>
   <li>If a three-or-more-way tie occurs, the first sudden-death question read will determine the winner (if answered correctly) or the loser (if answered incorrectly). A new 10-point question will be read to break each of the remaining ties, if necessary.</li>
   <li>If a tie occurs and one or more quizzers are ineligible, those who have quizzed out will be allowed back in to break the tie while those who struck out or fouled out will remain ineligible.</li>
   <li>If a tie occurs between quizzers who have struck out or fouled out, the tie will be broken by the normal rules.</li>
 </ol>
7. If necessary, time limits may be imposed by the Individual Tournament Coordinator or the National Bible Quiz Coordinator.
