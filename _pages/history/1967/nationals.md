Their back-to-back championsips record was equaled by First A/G, New Orleans, LA, First A/G, Tempe, AZ, Lakeland, FL, Orange, CA, Colorado Springs, CO and, most recently, by Owasso, OK.

While the complete list of participants, as well as the round by round schedule, is known, we do not possess any of the round by round information. Of course, top scorers were not officially announced until the next year (1968) so information on this will be difficult to obtain.
