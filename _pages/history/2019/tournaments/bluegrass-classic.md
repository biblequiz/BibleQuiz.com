   message="The Preliminary section of the awards determined all A-level stats. Middle school teams played against A teams, but none of those stats counted toward anything. In the afternoon, we split the A-division in two, and the top three teams competed for the top three spots. All Middle School stats were taken from the three matches the two MS teams played against each other."
