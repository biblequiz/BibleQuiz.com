The 49th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 3-8, 2011 in Dallas, Texas at the downtown Hyatt Hotel covering the gospel of John. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Kent Kloefkorn was the official question writer.

The national championship was won by Owasso First A/G, Owasso, OK (pictured). This was Owasso's third national championship, the other two being in 2008 and 2009. Owasso also won the round robin in 2010 however came in second following the Final Four playoffs. This was the fourth win for the state of Oklahoma (the other being in 1982) and the sixth win for the South Central region. Owasso is now the fifth team to win three national championships, the others being Decatur, GA (1963, 1976 and 1978), New Orleans, LA (1971, 1983 and 1984), Orange, CA (1999, 2002 and 2003) and Colorado Springs, CO (2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007).

This was the second year the Final Four format was used to determine the national champion. Coming in second place in the Final Four playoff was Garfield, NJ. Third place went to Wesley Chapel, FL and fourth place went to Central A/G, Springfield, MO. All four of these teams have histories of doing well at national finals. Garfield, who won the round robin with an 18-1 record (only the third team to do so) was also second place in the round robin in 2010 and finished third following the Final Four. Wesley Chapel finished third in the round robin in 2010 and won the Final Four as well as national finals. Central sent their 20th and 21st teams to national finals this year, having finished in the top four six other times.

The challenger division was won by Overland Park First A/G, Overland Park, KS.

The top scorer at the 2011 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the third consecutive and sixth overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). Abby was also top quizzer in 2010. This makes her the seventh person to be back-to-back high scorer at national finals. Abby's per quiz average was 131.58. This was the fifth highest average in history. Abby also quizzed out all 19 rounds, something that has only been accomplished once before, by Jon Galliers in 2006. Second high scorer was Tamera Burkhalter from Orlando, FL. Daniel Wagner and Jesse Wagner from Owasso, OK were third and fourth high scorers. Rounding out the top five was Catherine Hains from Bristow, VA.

The individual tournament was won by Daniel Wagner. This was the eleventh time the individual tournament was won by a member of the national championship team (including Daniel's 2009 win). Daniel and Abby battled for the title of quoting bee champion during the banquet and Abby won after the judges started asking them to quote three verses in 25 seconds.

The east-west took place on Thursday afternoon and the East won. In addition, an unofficial quiz with very hard, unusual and funny questions took place after the banquet between the top eight quizzers. The most notable of these was the 262 Part Answer asking the quizzer to give all the references for Jesus (5 minute time limit). Abby Rogers answered this in just over 4 minutes as the crowd erupted into vigorous applause. The set may be viewed here (there are a few accidentally invalid questions). We are in the process of getting several videos of this match which will be placed in the "Memories" section.

The invitational national one-on-one was won by Damon Comfort from Bellevue, WA.

4 separate matches against Garfield, NJ. 3 of these matches came down to the final question.

Defining the kingdom of God as either a where or a what. Jeremy won the contest, but the best part was the other team being so confused that they stand up to respond to the contest, and wind up unknowingly agreeing with it!
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
Couldn't come up with a favorite question. However, the least favorite question is "What is the verdict?" And all variations of it. All 3 quizzers are sick and tired of answering that question.
* **Favorite Verse from John**\
No Favorite verse, but the least favorite verse is the 'rhyming' verse. John 17:23. Verse must be read aloud or spoken for complete rhyming effect.

Aaron (one of our MSQ quizzers) was with us at the 3 Rivers tournament. We stopped for diner on the way home, and he ordered a maple bacon sundae...yes, he did eat it
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Quoting at the Bowling Green Courthouse on the National Day of Prayer.

Our other coach and two of our quizzers moved across state. We will miss them but I am happy to report that they will be starting a teen quiz team in their new church.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We were undefeated for the year going into league finals and lost to our second team! On the last question, the first chair of our second team quizzed out forwards for the first time all year. It was a great moment even with the loss.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
Quote verse 11:35... Thomas waited all year for it- he sat there and sat there while I thought "oh c'mon I know that one" Last 3 seconds, he gave the answer. They went to judges (correct - I think they were messing with him:)
* **Favorite Verse from John**\
John 20:29 Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2011/tournaments/michiana.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
We have a 2 plus hour drive to league meets the ride to the quiz meet is usually pretty quiet with the steady drone of quoting going on in back. The way home is a completely different story though - generalized mayhem pretty much describes it and falling asleep is not advised.

#### 5th Place

* **Church**: Radiant Life, Elkhart, IN
* **Coaches**:
  * John Hunter: John Hunter: Coached since 1980. I have been to Nationals now in three different decades. This is the first time I have ever coached back to back teams to Nationals. I have been the head coach for 6 trips and have been to three others as the assistant. This team has been so amazing. Last year we recieved a wild card to Nationals and really learned a lot. This year my kids have been saying they would return to Nationals all year long and i was not real surprised they made it. They were amazing all year long winning the Indiana District and advancing to Regionals as Indiana's top team. I quizzed one year as an 8th grader. That was so long ago I won't mention the year and we were not very good. I often wonder what brought me back to quizzing as I didn't like it much as a quizzer. I have loved all 30 + years of coaching and have also been the District and Regional Coordinator. My assistant coaches are Kim Walters and Joanne Schrock and they have been invaluable both in helping finance the team but also for their tremendous support of me personally. Once again I can say I have enjoyed coaching this team so much. They are fun but also at times unpredictable. I think because we have expected a lot out ourselves, we have gotten in trouble more than once during a quiz match.

    * SeAyra Walters: Earned the National Memorization award.

* **Team History**\
With this being our second time at Nationals we are hoping to make the top bracket. We finished in the bottom half of the Challenger Bracket last year and hope to get into the Championship this year. I can honestly say this team has worked much harder and performed a lot better in pressure situations. We attended two tournaments, the Gobblefest and james River. At the Gobblefest we were second in our Bracket, going undefeated till the last round against Garfield. Garfield was awesome and handled that match easily but I think we learned a lot from that. We did not do so well at the River classic but I think it helped us prepare for District Finals which were the next week. At District Finals we finished in First Place and went undefeated. Regionals was in indianapolis and we had a very good draw. We lost 4 rounds on Friday and went 5 and 4 and need to win our last four matches on Saturday which we did. That put us in a tie for 3rd place but we were placed 5th as we beat Lexington but Lexington beat Ohio's 2nd team and they beat us. That placed us 5th but we were going to Nationals.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had several throughout the year but probably quizzing Greater Lansing first round on Saturday morning at Great Lakes Regional Finals was our most exciting. We knew we had to win out to advance to Nationals and we won with a solid performance on our way to going undefeated on Saturday.
* **Favorite Contest**\
I don't really have one. The amazing thing about this team is last year I couldn't get them to contest at all and certainly couldn't get them to present a contest. By the time we got to Nationals last year they were willing to present and that continued until now. I am amazed at how these girls have grown up this year and really become a mature team. We haven't arrived but we are making headway.

After an all weekend quiz practice, Daniel B. almost broke his leg when he jumped off the shed roof onto a trampoline. His foot stuck in the springs as he catapulted head over heels, Drew had to jump down onto the trampoline to extricate Daniel's leg from the springs. Austin videotaped the entire escapade.

* **Team History**\
Central has competed at more national finals than any other team. Their first appearance was in 1976 when only eight teams went to nationals. They were the first team to appear at nationals for an entire cycle, from 1986 to 1993. They also went in 1995, through 1997, 1999 through 2001 and every year since 2008. This is the second time they have sent two teams to nationals. Former team members include two top scorers, Jhan Hurst and Marcae Johnson, as well as Karl Dawson and website administrator Joey Bohanon. Central placed third in 1976, 1987, 1996 and 2000 and second in 1988 and 1997.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The Final Match of the Xtreme Tournament in Owasso was exciting as it sealed an undefeated record for "Without Limit". Owasso (Central's opponent) in the last match had only 1 loss and would win the tie-breaker on points. Matthew Klika needed the final four questions for a quiz-out to give WL the championship. He nailed it, and the rest is history (although these stats aren't posted on the website, so maybe they're not history :D)!
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Ones we get accepted. Honestly, we find most of our contests are spent arguing basic grammar rules for the English language.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Statement and Quotation Question. From The Section Titled, "Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand."\
Although it's not true, one verse makes it sound like Andrew promoted cannibalism.\
Quote it.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:

  * Matthew: 12:36a
  * Richard: 3:30
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
What's a non-quiz related moment? Just kidding! After the Xtreme tournament, the team got rowdy and celebrated with dinner at Monterey's in Tulsa! Daniel went the restroom (don't worry, it's still PG), and as he exited, he forgot he wasn't at home and accidentally turned out the lights. Unfortunately, there was still someone in the restroom, and Daniel heard a furious scream from the stall. Daniel was startled and high-tailed (an Ozarks term) it outta there coming back to the group with an embarrassed look. The rest of the group got a laugh, but there still may be a man trying to make his way out of a restroom in a Tulsa dining establishment.\
\
Another non-quiz related moment was the two days spent in McAlester after our church van broke down on the way from Gold Cup.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Other than day-to-day expressing growth in their godly character, each of them has had opportunities to model what they have gleaned from Bible Quiz. Daniel quotes everywhere and usually will end up being noticed in public to the point of conversation starting. Matthew had an opportunity to volunteer in tornado devastated Joplin, and Emily is continually held in high regard by her public school peers as a person of faith who can lend answers any time.

* **Team History**\
We have been good friends since Green Bay Nationals and have gotten to know each other better and better every year. When the Oss Family moved to MO our team was an instant perfect fit. We have lots of fun and really enjoy each other's company.\
*(Editor's Note: The two Central teams this year are teams #20 and #21 to make it to nationals. This is also the second year that Central has sent two teams to nationals).*
* **Most exciting match this season**\
When we played the Brookbanks at the James River Classic. Even though it wasn't "exciting" in the suspenseful sense, we had a ton of fun partying and contesting (for the other team even.) They were snacking and laughing; we were scribbling notes and giggling. Much to our quizmaster's chagrin we just couldn't be quiet. Jed was making the best blonde jokes right in the middle of the match, only to be met with Bri's homeschooler jokes still in the middle of the match. (Not to say anything about the three blonde homeschoolers on our team.) To make it all the funnier-Brianna's brother fell asleep mid-match and started snoring. All of a sudden there were three cameras flashing and taking pictures and no one on either one of the teams was trying to suppress the giggles. By the end of the match everyone was practically in tears from laughing so hard. When it came down to it, it didn't even matter that we lost miserably we just had a blast goofing off with our friends.
* **Favorite Contest**\
Where to begin? We have had so many crazy contests that a lot of them stand out. One that was especially silly was at the Owasso Extreme Tournament. Basically the question was asking how the scripture was fulfilled from John chapter 17. Brianna hit the question perfectly and completed the question exactly how it was supposed to be worded. But when it came to the answer- suffice it to say, Bri pretty much gave the entire essence of how Judas betrayed Jesus (including the kiss of betrayal not recorded in John), Jesus' death and resurrection, the plan of salvation, all of Jesus' miracles, and all the key points of John's Gospel, gesticulating wildly the whole time. She was counted wrong, of course. But in order to win the match we needed to get this and the next question right- so we contested. In an answer you're allowed to use your own words so the short version of Ellen's contest was, "Although Bri said absolutely nothing that you have on your page, the answer she gave answered the question. All those things are what fulfilled the scripture." It was a stretch to say the least and all the judges laughed at us, but it was worth it to see the puzzled look on the Wagner's faces as they scrambled to get a rebuttal together.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
Our favorite question this year was written by Greg House. It was something along these lines:\
For 20 points. Statement and quotation question. In one sentence John makes it sound as though Andrew is a cannibal. Quote this sentence.\
It made everyone in the room go "Huh??" but Ellen got it anyway. (See John 6:8-9)
* **Favorite Verse from John**
  * Brianna: John 14:27: Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
  * Amie: John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.
  * Ellen: John 13:34-35: A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**
When WE WENT AND GOT MATCHING TATTOOS!!! It was the craziest, most bonding thing we've ever done together.\
\
JUST KIDDING! That wasn't our best non-quiz related moment.\
\
Our *real* best non-quiz related moment was when we were invited to Silver Dollar City for the day to do a commercial photo shoot. We rode roller-coasters for free all day long and got to stop for dinner on the way home.\
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Beyond the church we have had many opportunities to use the things we've learned from Quiz. As a team we believe everyday is a new chance to show God's love and exhibit the virtues we have learned from memorizing the word of God. For example Amie uses her knowledge of the Bible to witness and debate with kids all over the world online, as well as to connect with other kids who love the Lord. She also helps out with the three year old nursery. Along with her team mates, Amie contributes to the Women's and Royal Rangers ministries.\
\
Brianna leads a Bible study group for kids, and ministers using her talents in the two year old nursery. She helps as a full-time nanny and babysitter, showing the love God has for us as His children. Brianna also volunteers with Convoy of Hope and Royal Rangers.\
\
Ellen makes sure her family's Compassion child is covered in prayer and encouraged in her walk with the Lord by sending letters and keeping up close communications. She uses leadership skills that she has gained from quizzing to help guide and direct the younger generation through babysitting the neighborhood kids. Ellen also volunteers with Convoy of Hope and Royal Rangers.

* **Team History**\
This will be Racine's 5th year attending Nationals and 3rd year in a row.
* **Most Exciting Match This Season**
  * Nathan's most exciting match was our Regional game against Cedar Rapids. We knew that we needed to win this game if we wanted a shot at winning Regionals. The match was very close. They led in the beginning. Nathan had gotten a 20 pointer wrong, but then got two of the 30 pointers. Josiah Coder (one of the top quizzers in our region) got the remaining 30 pointer. Nathan quizzed out forward, then Josiah quizzed out. Then our other two quizzers closed out the game for us. Renee had 85 points and Aimee had 20 points. We ended up winning a very good game.
  * Aimee's most exciting match was a match during one of our league meets. The judges had conferred for a very long time on a contest. By the time they had voted on the contest a second time, they were saying our time was up and we were only half way through the match. But then they realized that nobody had written down the official time that we started the match, so we got to finish it.
  * Renee's most exciting match was the one where she scored 150 points for the first time in time in her TBQ career.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**
  * Nathan's favorite quiz question was a 30 point question from Regionals. 8 part answer. From John chapter 12. In order of appearance, which individuals are named?
  * Renee's favorite quiz question was from Joey Bohannon's National level practice set. Statement and quotation question. Around the vernal and autumnal equinoxes there are exactly 12 hours of daylight. Quote the verse in which Jesus refers to this fact.
* **Favorite Verse of John**\
John 16:33

  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2011/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Best Non-Quiz Related Moment**
  * Nathan's best non-quiz moment was going to Josiah Coder's house during Regionals and eating out at a Mexican restaurant.
  * Aimee and Renee's best non-quiz moment was witnessing to a homeless man on the way home from Regionals.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Aimee uses Bible Quiz to answer some of her friends questions about her faith. Renee uses her Bible knowledge to witness to her friends and encourage them.

* **Most exciting match this season**\
At lunch break on the first day of Regionals, our record was 1-2. After taking time to strategize and regroup, we went on to win the rest of our games that weekend, including a win against the only undefeated team on Saturday morning. 
* **Favorite contest**\
We have two, both from Regionals. In our second match, our second quizzer answered a question, was counted incorrect, she conferred and chose not to contest. The coach from the other team contested on her behalf that she gave the correct answer. The contest was accepted and the points awarded to our team. The cool thing about this contest is that our Youth Pastor was in the audience and he asked why the other team would do that. It was a great opportunity to explain that it was about integrity and doing the right thing, what a witness that coach was to others.\
Also, we contested on the second question of a match for validity and the contest was accepted. Then, when the substitute question was read, we also contested the validity of that one and won that contest. Déjà vu moment! 
* **Favorite verses of the quizzers**
  * Josiah: John 1:12: Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-
  * Hannah: John 3:30: He must become greater; I must become less.
  * Leah: John 16:33: "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2011/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
When we were trying to come up with a name for our team this year and brainstorming different possibilities, we all laughed about one that Bekah came up with and then kept going with more options. After several minutes of further discussion, a few of us said we really liked the one that Bekah had suggested - but none of us could remember it! As hard as we all tried to remember, we couldn't Talk about frustrating! You'd think that quizzers would have a better memory. So our team name became, Why Question Me?
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Just talking with people in our everyday lives about Bible Quiz, it opens up the opportunity to share the Gospel.

* **Team History**\
Northfield Church has had a TBQ team for the past 6 years. They won Districts last year, but were not able to attend Regionals. This year, 2010-11, they were undefeated by Nebraska teams and went on to place 3rd at Regionals.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Sioux Falls, South Dakota was the only team to beat Northfield in the monthly meets in Nebraska. When they faced them again at Regionals, South Dakota called a time out and the three starters all ran out of the room, but came back just as time was called. This might have been a ploy to throw Northfield off track, but they went on to win the match and edged S.D. in total points at Regionals by only 5 points.
* **Favorite Contest**\
At the end of a round at District Finals, the coach from the opposing team contested that the entire round should be redone because of hindrance from two of Northfield's quizzers who are dating and obviously fond of each other.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
At Regionals, one of the questions in set 5 caught us a little off-guard:\
Question number 3 for 30 points. Statement and Two-part Quotation Question. Four-part Answer. The Assemblies of God ninth statement of faith declares sanctification is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication unto God.\
Quote, and give the complete references for the verses in which sanctification is mentioned.
* **Favorite Verse of the Quizzers**\
In a serious manner, the quizzers appreciate the vulnerable humanity of Jesus, and yet the strength of resolve, found in John 12:27: "Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? Father save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour."\
In a lighthearted way, every time one of the team buzzes in and answers with a guess, we ask, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?" (based on John 7:15)
* **Favorite Non-Quiz Related Moment**\
To save money at Regionals, Cedar Rapids Assembly of God graciously allowed Gering Northfield and Hastings Northshore to stay two nights camping inside the church. For their group devotions on the last night, there was a spontaneous time of worship led by one of the adults who had brought his guitar. The eclectic group of worshippers was made up of various ages from four denominations representing six different churches, yet the worship went on for almost two hours. They were actually living out John 4:23, "Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks."
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
The community of Bridgeport, Nebraska has been positively commenting on the Northfield team testimony published in their local newspaper. Even non-Christians have congratulated the team members; saying how awesome it is that teenagers of today are memorizing entire books of the Bible.

Friendship Classic 2011 - In our game against Central Assembly from Springfield, MO, we overcame a 130-point deficit on question 10 to win the match. It was a fun game.
* **Favorite Contest**\
Absolutely nothing even remotely interesting. Hoping for a good one at Nationals.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
It wasn't our favorite, as we got a little burned by it, but it was memorable. I'm speaking of a certain, LONG statement and question that was asked at Regionals.
* **Favorite Verse from John**\
John 21:13: Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.

As we were driving to Gobblefest, a deer ran across the road into the side of our van. The deer died.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
While not technically outside the church (or even our team), this season has yielded some wonderful spiritual growth in a very personal way.\
\
Two individuals new to church joined Bible Quiz this year. Through personal study and peer/coach mentorship, one of them was led to accept Jesus as their savior. Two other quizzers were so inspired by Jesus' baptism that they took the next step in their spiritual journey by being baptized on New Year's Eve. It was a powerful and awesome experience made even more special by all the teammates and coaches who celebrated with them.\
\
Bible Quiz is NOT just a ministry for those who are already Christians. It has the power to change lives. I challenge teams out there to recruit the saved and unsaved students alike,

* **Team History**\
Cedar Park this year ties the record for consecutive appearances at Nationals, with 14 consecutive years. The highest finish was 1st place in 2005; combined with 4th place finishes in 2004 and 2010, and a four-year string of 2nd place finishes from 2006-2009, that makes 7 consecutive years finishing in the top four. Cedar Park also has the distinction of being the only church to place two teams in the top ten in the same year, with a 1st-and-10th finish in 2005. Finally, Cedar Park holds the record for the only "perfect match" recorded at Nationals: all four quizzers quizzed out positively in a single match during the first day of competition in 2008. (Editor's Note: This was the first time it was achieved with 430 points possible, however it has happened before with 380 points possible).
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At the West Coast Open in sunny Santa Ana in March, we had lost twice to the talented Phoenix North Valley team, and were really motivated to try to avoid the sweep by getting that final match with them. It was neck and neck the whole way, with no lead greater than 35 for either team, four lead changes, and a tie score after 17. Chad of Phoenix got a 20 on 18, and we called a time out, knowing we needed both the remaining questions (a 10 and a 20) to win. The twins each pulled one (Ani the 10 and Adi the 20) to come through!
* **Favorite Contest**
Can't remember! I know we've had some doozies, but they escape my memory.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
The first morning of quizzing at the West Coast Open, the very first question in the very first quiz was one we had just asked in warm-ups, barely 10 minutes prior. It made for an impressive start! =)
* **Favorite Verse from John**\
John 1:16: From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * West Coast Classic
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
We played a game at our Christmas party based on a new game called "Things," and had some pretty funny answers. Everyone thinks of an answer to a category-type question, and then you try to guess whose answer is whose.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Well, we actually did set up the buzzers and quiz at Sea-Tac International Airport on the way to the West Coast Open, but I don't think that's quite what you mean. =) At her school, Anita has been encouraging classmates to memorize Scripture.

Our BQ program has grown and we have 15 quizzers that have quizzed this year. They have also competed in Fine Arts and won many awards there. However our pastor has challenged the BQ department along with the other departments to "go out to the mission field". We chose as our mission field a Hispanic church on the south side of the city to partner with. Last year in August we did out first project which was to hand out school supplies. Expecting about 100 people at the most, we were overwhelmed when over 1000 people showed up. We did not have enough supplies for everyone, but started with backpacks until they were gone, then bags of school supplies till they were gone, then handed out $5.00 gift cards to Wal-mart. We were able to deliver the gospel message along with the supplies to over 500 people. This year we plan to do it again at the end of July, and are hoping to give away 1000 backpacks. We have also ministered at Halloween with a Trunk-or-Treat and then with an Easter Egg hunt at Easter. As a BQ team we have learned the value of learning Gods word so we can share it with others.

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
We always go snow tubing on Saturday night after the Friendship in Pittsburg (3 years running now). This year, the weather was a little warmer, to the point to where a lot of the snow had melted during the day and refrozen that night making a very icy (and very fast) slope. It was the coach's bright idea to have a little competition among the group to see who could make all the way to the padding about 50 yards past the stopping point). All of the quizzers went first and a couple of them actually made it. It was now the coach's turn and he was NOT going to be out-done. Needless to say, the coach was moving at a "super-sonic" speed coming down the steep slope. So much so, that he was unable to slow down before CRASHING into the wall and almost KILLING himself. Of course, the quizzers were laughing so hard that they couldn't even help him up! Fortunately, there were no broken bones, just a LOT of soreness, bruises, and a damaged ego.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
We recently used our Bible Quiz to minister on an all church missions trip to South Africa (2009) and the Canary Islands (2010) and Guatamala (2011).

* **Team History**\
This is our first year of quizzing therefore our first Nationals as well as our first Regionals that we just participated in.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
During head to head playoffs at Regionals when we beat both Tocoa GA and Orlando FL the exciting thing was that we had quizzed Orlando during our league competitions and had not won against them except for once, so the kids were pretty excited to be able to win against them at Regionals.
* **Favorite contest**\
When David contested on wrong question from John he was basing the contest on a totally different question.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
When Daniel answered 9th statement of faith of the assembly of God which mentions sanctification from John 17.
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
When David got a paper clip stuck in his tooth during one of our practices for Regionals. It took some time but we got it out - then back to practice.
* **Favorite Verse from John**
  * Rachel: John 7:24
  * Daniel: John 5:39
  * David: John 14:27
  * Toby: John 21:2
  * Oore: John 17:25-26
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
The team has been able to use bible quiz at school to their peers and it has been a witness.

This particular team has been together (mostly- changing a few quizzers) for two years now of Regionals and Nationals qualification and attendance.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Any of our matches against Living Hope were always entertaining. The most exciting matches were the one or two at Regional finals that were won on the last question. Another joyful match was the last match of Regionals, when we could tell near the end that we would win, giving us a perfect record.
* **Favorite Contest**\
The most memorable moment from a contest this season was when Kory said, "I can like chocolate, and you can like chocolate, but that doesn't mean we're friends!"
* **Favorite Quiz Question**
Question for 10 points: What was said plainly?\
Answer: "Lazarus is dead!"\
Any question we know the answers to.
* **Favorite Verse from John**
  * Kory: 8:43
  * Kyle: 15:13
  * Carley: 3:19-21
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
Playing Laser Tag and Putt-Putt after Regionals, all of our fun lunches at Qdoba, and driving in the van :)
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Carley: I personally use my quiz knowledge a lot in school, when people come up to me looking for answers to tough religious questions or searching for verses to help a point and solve a riddle in their head. I have often been able to give someone a good chapter from the bible to read- chapters I wouldn't have known had I not been a part of quiz. Books of the Bible I wouldn't have read that come up every day in my normal life.

* **Team History**\
We are a very small church where about 3/4 of the youth group is made up of students who were involved with quizzing. The church had no quizzing ministry when I came, but Pastor Scott had coached quizzing back when he was Pastor at Oak Orchard A/G in Medina, NY and was very excited to have quizzing and is extremely supportive. This is our first year at nationals and regionals.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
James River "Condemned Already" team @ the Missouri Classic. It came right down to the end with two contests and even a request for a tournament co-ordinators decision.
* **Favorite Contest**\
The question asked for the two verses in which living water is named. Our team answered and gave an additional answer. We contested on Additional Scripture and the other team contested that it was an invalid question because there are three answers and the question implied that there were only two.
* **Favorite Quiz Question**\
20 Part Answer. What chapters is Jesus found in?\
Statement and Question. Your 16th birthday is sometimes referred to as your "Sweet 16th". Quote John 16:16.
* **Favorite Verse from John**\
Birthday verse: July 19 - 7:19 and Dec 25 - 12:25\
John 9:34 To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Missouri Classic]({% link _pages/history/2011/tournaments/missouri-classic.md %})
  * West Coast Classic
* **Favorite Non-Quiz Related Moment**\
While we were at the West Coast open we went to the Ocean. In the sand there was small patches of globs of tar and Chad got some on his knee and it didn't come off. I had to go to Home Depot and buy "Goof Off" to remove the tar. When I came back he was on the bathroom floor trying to rub it off with water and toilet paper with the rest of the team standing around him, laughing because it just wasn't working. Also at Regional's, Morgan walked into hotel room 216 thinking it was our room 316 (The door was open but still embarrassing).
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
On the way back from Regionals we stopped at Denny's for supper. We were all wearing our Regionals T-shirts and the Manager asked who and what we were. We got to tell him about Bible Quiz and Ashley even got to quote for him.
