The 49th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 3-8, 2011 in Dallas, Texas at the downtown Hyatt Hotel covering the gospel of John. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Kent Kloefkorn was the official question writer.

The national championship was won by Owasso First A/G, Owasso, OK (pictured). This was Owasso's third national championship, the other two being in 2008 and 2009. Owasso also won the round robin in 2010 however came in second following the Final Four playoffs. This was the fourth win for the state of Oklahoma (the other being in 1982) and the sixth win for the South Central region. Owasso is now the fifth team to win three national championships, the others being Decatur, GA (1963, 1976 and 1978), New Orleans, LA (1971, 1983 and 1984), Orange, CA (1999, 2002 and 2003) and Colorado Springs, CO (2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007).

This was the second year the Final Four format was used to determine the national champion. Coming in second place in the Final Four playoff was Garfield, NJ. Third place went to Wesley Chapel, FL and fourth place went to Central A/G, Springfield, MO. All four of these teams have histories of doing well at national finals. Garfield, who won the round robin with an 18-1 record (only the third team to do so) was also second place in the round robin in 2010 and finished third following the Final Four. Wesley Chapel finished third in the round robin in 2010 and won the Final Four as well as national finals. Central sent their 20th and 21st teams to national finals this year, having finished in the top four six other times.

The challenger division was won by Overland Park First A/G, Overland Park, KS.

The top scorer at the 2011 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the third consecutive and sixth overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). Abby was also top quizzer in 2010. This makes her the seventh person to be back-to-back high scorer at national finals. Abby's per quiz average was 131.58. This was the fifth highest average in history. Abby also quizzed out all 19 rounds, something that has only been accomplished once before, by Jon Galliers in 2006. Second high scorer was Tamera Burkhalter from Orlando, FL. Daniel Wagner and Jesse Wagner from Owasso, OK were third and fourth high scorers. Rounding out the top five was Catherine Hains from Bristow, VA.

The individual tournament was won by Daniel Wagner. This was the eleventh time the individual tournament was won by a member of the national championship team (including Daniel's 2009 win). Daniel and Abby battled for the title of quoting bee champion during the banquet and Abby won after the judges started asking them to quote three verses in 25 seconds.

The east-west took place on Thursday afternoon and the East won. In addition, an unofficial quiz with very hard, unusual and funny questions took place after the banquet between the top eight quizzers. The most notable of these was the 262 Part Answer asking the quizzer to give all the references for Jesus (5 minute time limit). Abby Rogers answered this in just over 4 minutes as the crowd erupted into vigorous applause. The set may be viewed here (there are a few accidentally invalid questions). We are in the process of getting several videos of this match which will be placed in the "Memories" section.

The invitational national one-on-one was won by Damon Comfort from Bellevue, WA.
