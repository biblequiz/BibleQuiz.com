The 46th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 6-11, 2008 in Green Bay, WI at the Hotel Sierra covering the epistles of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Aaron Kohler was the official question writer. This was the first of two years in which Aaron wrote questions.

The championship division was won by Owasso First Assembly of God, Owasso, OK (pictured). This was the first of two consecutive years that this church won nationals. They were also undefeated both during the preliminary rounds and the regular rounds. This was only the fourth time since expansion that a team went undefeated during the regular rounds. The other three teams were all from Orange, CA, in 1999, 2002 and 2003. The second place team was Cedar Park A/G, Bothell, WA. This marked the third or four straight year that Bothell was second place. This year tied a 30-year old record held by Riverside, CA for longest second place streak (they were second in 1978, 1979 and 1980). Bothell was the national champion in 2005, though, a feat that Riverside never accomplished. The third place team was James River A/G, "One in Christ", Ozark, MO. This was James River's fourth straight year in third place. The challenger division was won by James River A/G, "In Chains", Ozark, MO.

This marked the fourth overall year in which the South Central region has won nationals.

The top scorer at the 2008 National Finals was first-year quizzer Grant Warnock from Bridgeville, PA. Grant's per quiz average was 110. Finishing only 70 points behind Grant was Jared Burkhalter, top scorer from 2007 and 2009.

The individual tournament was won by Blake Porter of Ozark, MO. The quoting bee was won by Joshua Wagner of Owasso, OK. Joshua is the only quizzer so far to win back-to-back quoting bees. He is also the only person from the national championship team to win the quoting bee. The East won the East-West quiz, for the first time since the east-west quiz began in 1999. The boys won the Boy-Girl quiz.
