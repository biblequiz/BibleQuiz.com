## A League

After 13 rounds the 'A' League ended with a 3-way tie for second place.  Lakeshore Vineyard, Holland won State Finals with a
12-1 record, but because they are non-A/G, will not be moving on to Regionals.
So the teams in the three way tie were quizzing for trophy spots.

## Novice Division

We had seven teams in the Novice League.  Resurrection Life had a perfect day with 7-0 record.
This team is 6th and 7th graders.  Again, Resurrection Life is a non-A/G church and will not be going on to regionals.
