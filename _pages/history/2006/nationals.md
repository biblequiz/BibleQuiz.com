The 44th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 2-7, 2006 in Lexington, KY at the Marriott Lexington Griffin Gate Resort covering the epistles of Romans and James. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Richard Ely was the official question writer. This was the second year in which Richard wrote questions for nationals.

The championship division was won by The Church at Briargate "Speed and Finality", Colorado Springs, CO. The second place team was Cedar Park A/G, Bothell, WA, who won nationals in 2005. The third place team was James River A/G "Joy", Ozark, MO. The challenger division was won by First A/G, Lafayette, IN.

This marks the seventeenth overall year in which the Southwest region has won nationals. This was also the third of four national championships for The Church at Briargate. They also won in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Team coach Greg House was coach of the 1993 championship team from Lakewood, CA, the 1999 and 2003 championship teams from Orange, CA and also would return to coach the 2007 championship team from Colorado Springs, CO. This was the third national championship for Molly Pace. Andrew Kelley and Michael Rose would go on to win the 2007 national championship.

The top scorer at the 2006 National Finals was Jon Galliers from Lexington, KY. Jon's per quiz average was 132.63. A new rulebook this year made it five questions for a quiz-out with a 20 point bonus, so it is a little difficult to compare that to previous years. Regardless, this was certainly one of the best performances in recent years. Jon also quizzed out in every single round, a feat that has never been accomplished since expansion (although several in several recent years some quizzers might have quizzed out every round if they needed five to quiz out). This is Jon's second consecutive year as top quizzer. He joins Sharon Workman (1966-1967), John Wootton (1983-1984), Lisa Wootton (1993-1994) and Kent Piacenti (1997-1999). Jon was also second in 2004 and fourth in 2003.

The individual tournament was won by Brandon Duffy of Bothell, WA. The quoting bee was won by Jenna Jo Duffy of Bothell, WA. The west won their eighth consecutive east-west quiz.
