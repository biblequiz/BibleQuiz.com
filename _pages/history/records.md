> The web site has gone through multiple iterations with different people volunteering as owners. These records were up-to-date as of the 2011 season, but haven't been refreshed with all the latest records. If you'd like to assist, please email [hello@biblequiz.com](mailto:hello@biblequiz.com).

Comparing accomplishments from year-to-year is difficult for multiple reasons and proving one quizzer better than another across eras of quizzing is almost impossible:
* Different amounts of material to memorize from year to year.
* Differing question writers, styles, and rules. For example, questions were rarely interrupted in the early years.
* Varying levels and quality of competition.
* Varying competition formats from year to year.

For a detailed explanation of the differences across the years, see the [Eras of Quizzing]({% link _pages/history/eras-of-quizzing.md %}) page.

Naturally, with the most recent expansions, National Finals became more of a marathon than in the past. The eight team format from the early years certainly favored a team that was "hot" on a given day, while the modern format requires a great deal of mental and physical stamina. However, with the eight team format, one loss sometimes meant the championship and easier matches were few or or non-existent. An individual quizzer who had one difficult quiz in the modern era might easily recover in the remaining twenty plus rounds. Certainly quizzers have more rounds now to cover for a bad game and retain their average, but they must also keep up their level of quizzing over approximately 20 rounds and two to three days. There is no doubt that some quizzers from the modern era would do better in the previous formats, and vice-versa.

With this understanding, comparable data is offered by category. Just as an Olympic champion is always an Olympic champion, and historical records are kept for each event, the following Bible Quiz records are kept to retain the history of the program and to allow everyone to see all of the accomplishments. Therefore, when listing ranks for one high score (etc.) over another, it is an attempt  to show the progression of the program and each individual or team accomplishment. Some of these accomplishments are phenomenally better than those before them, and might happen to be the best ever if the 50+ champions all played each other at the same time, over the same material, at the same age and with the same questions. We ask that you take them as they are, and that each new generation of quizzers use them as inspiration to drive their learning of God's word.

Preliminary rounds or the Challenger Division are excluded out of fairness to teams quizzing before 2000 and 2000 - 2006 Regional Champions not participating in preliminary rounds. Scores from all years have been normalized as the maximum number of points changed in 2006 from 380 to 430. The formula for normalized points is `(380 / 430) * (points)`. To aid in comparison, percentages are typically used. Since the exact year during the 1970s when the number of questions for a quiz-out changed from five to six is unknown, it is assumed as six for all relevant years. This has little effect as there are minimal records from that time.

Ultimately the records are what they are and do not make for perfect comparisons. All of these eras have differences which affect the outcome of our records. However, the purpose of this data is not comparison, rather the celebration of team and individual achievement in quizzing.

\* Although 16 teams went to Nationals, they were divided into two separate groups of 8, played a 7-game round robin, and then moved into playoffs. For these two years, their percentage was based on their combined 7-game round robin and playoff performance.\
\*\* Playoff rounds are included in the round robin percentage as it is impossible to have a full picture of the win-loss record without it.

### Best National Team Champions By Average Margin

> Missing several years due missing official printouts for these years, although the results were announced at the official competition.

Ranking is based on the "winning margin" (sum, over all matches, of a team's score minus their opponent's score).

### Largest National 1st/2nd Place Margin of Victory

The last record measured years where National Championship was very closely decided between multiple teams. This record is just the opposite. The gap described below is the difference between the number of wins of the first place team and second place team. Only years with a 2 or more game difference are listed. The remaining years were all won by 1 game. See the records above for details on why two teams had a negative margin.

> From 1963-1965 the only way to win was by being undefeated because the competition was a single-elimination tournament consisting of 8 teams (top team from each region).

### Perfect Games at National Finals

A perfect game indicates a team getting the highest possible score, which requires the highest possible number of quiz-outs. Before 2006 this number was three. From 2006 on, that number is four. For teams with only three quizzers, any match where all three quiz out, with no errors or fouls also counts as a perfect game, provided the unanswered questions are all 10s.

### 300/340 Games at National Finals

For all the years that 380 was the maximum score for a single team, a game in which a team scored 300 or more points in a single match was considered a phenomenal match. This is a (mostly) complete list of how many 300+ games have occurred at National Finals. Once the maximum score for a single team was raised to 430 points in 2006, the same percentage of total score that applied to a 380 game (78.94 percent of the possible points) was applied to the new 430-point total, yielding an equally phenomenal match of 340 points.

| Year | Games | Scores                                   | Team                                      | Coach               |

### National Champions, but not Regional Champions

> From 1963 to 1983, only regional champions competed at Nationals.

This record commends the teams putting in the extra effort between Regional and National Finals.

| Year | Team                                     | Regionals |
| ---: | ---------------------------------------- | --------: |
| 2010 | Victorous Life Church, Wesley Chapel, FL |       2nd |
| 2000 | Mountain View A/G, Las Vegas, NV*        |       3rd |
| 1996 | Grace A/G, Syracuse, NY                  |       2nd |
| 1991 | Carpenter's Home Church, Lakeland, FL    |       2nd |
| 1990 | Carpenter's Home Church, Lakeland, FL    |       2nd |
| 1989 | Citrus Heights A/G, Citrus Heights, CA   |       2nd |

\* Six teams placed second at Regional Finals, while only Mountain View A/G, Las Vegas, NV placed third at Regional Finals.

### 8+ Consecutive Championship Division Appearences

No team accomplished this feat when only eight teams were allowed to attend (prior to 1986). Only one team is known to have won eight consecutive regional championships. A different number of teams were allowed to attend Nationals across the years. If five teams were always permitted to attend, other teams would certaintly have made it to more Nationals, such as Central A/G, Springfield, MO that would have attended in 1994 and 1998 making a 16 year streak; a similar scenario exists for Bouldercrest/Decatur. This record also only takes into account whether a church had a team at national finals, ignoring if they sent multiple teams. For a detailed explanation of the differences across the years, see the [Eras of Quizzing]({% link _pages/history/eras-of-quizzing.md %}) page.

\* In 2002, Bothell's "second" team was in the championship division while their "first" team was in the challenger division. Chandra Porter coached the "second" team that year.\
\*\* The entire team moved to another church. Radiant Church planted Briargate and the entire team moved.

### 10+ Championsip Division Appearances

This record includes if a church sent multiple teams in one year. Since this record only includes the Championship Division, multiple teams aren't included:
* Fort Myers, FL
* Tacoma, WA
* Orlando, FL
* Santa Ana, CA
* Dunwoody, GA
* Lexington, KY
* West Lafayette, IN
* Radiant Church, Colorado Springs, CO attended in 1995, but didn't make it out of the third-place tournament.

### Highest Individual Average

No scores have been altered. The number of questions for a quiz-out is now 5, but the bonus points are now 20. To an extent, these factors off-set each other. Under this system, no new quizzer will ever break the record set by Kent Piacenti in 1999, however, Kent achieved his record with sixteen perfect games (160). Even under today's slighty relaxed standards, no one else has ever come close to his record.

### Difference in Avg Score between 1st and 2nd

> No data for 1963 - 1978, 1984, 1989, 1991

Since the total possible score differs significantly over the years (see [Eras of Quizzing]({% link _pages/history/eras-of-quizzing.md %}) for more details), the differences are listed by average points per game. Consider that a 100-point gap when there are 19 games is different than when there are only 7 games.

Other interesting observations related to this data:
* In 1980, only 10 points per game separated the top 5 quizzers.
* In 1982, 8.58 points per game separated the top 3 quizzers.
* In 2000, 12.63 points per game separated the top 4 quizzers.

All years for which we have data are included. In some years, this gap was extraordinarily high. The highest scoring quizzer is listed first for each year.

### Highest Forward Quiz-Outs

> Data either missing or not kept for 1963-1989 and 1992.

Since 2006's change to 5 for a quiz out, this statistic is slightly skewed. Jon Galliers is the only quizzer to quiz out forward every round, however in both 1998 and 1999, Kent would've done so as well given only 5 for a quiz out.
