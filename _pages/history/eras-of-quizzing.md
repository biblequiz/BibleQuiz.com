Bible Quiz began in the 1961-62 season covering the book of acts with District-level competition. Regional and National competitions weren't held until 1963. The history section has been divided into multiple eras.

## Single Elimination Era (1963 - 1965)

The first three National Finals (1963 - 1965) were single elimination events composed of the winners of each of the eight regions.

**Noteworthy Rules**:
* Quizzer could only answer five correct to quiz-out or answer-out.
* If a quizzer answered three incorrectly, they errored-out and a team was not allowed to replace that individual.
 
**Statistical Notes**:
* 8 total teams competing.
* Top scorers were not officially announced until 1968 and the single elimination format makes determining a top scorer difficult. As a guideline, the top scorer from the winning team has been selected as the top scorer for the event.
* Due to the single elimination format, it is virtually impossible to compare the results of these years with those of other eras. However, the [records]({% link _pages/history/records.md %}) do include certain statistics such as winner and top scorers.
* Results from this incipient era are sparse, so these years may never fully be incorporated into the records.

## Eight Team Era (1966 - 1985)

From 1966 to 1985, Bible Quiz National Finals consisted of eight-team round-robins, which was a great advance for all the participants. Still, only the winners of each of the eight regions was allowed to participate.

**Noteworthy Rule Changes**:
* Error-out quizzers could be replaced.
* Answering out (i.e., quizzing out) required six correct answers.
* Addition of on-time points (10).
* Question writing rules made interrupting very difficult. For example, a question could contain the word "quote" without a declaration of it being scripture text.

**Statistical Notes**:
* 8 team round robin.
* 16 teams competed in 1984 and 1985 in separate 8 team divisions with a playoff between the top teams from each division.

**Noteworthy Years**:
* *1983: College-aged teenagers excluded from quizzing*\
Until this year, the rules stated that a quizzer could participate as long as they were not 19 in September of the beginning quiz year. This meant that certain individuals born in the last three months of the year could quiz a total of eight years (often in college in the extra one or two years). Concerns about the large gap in age between 7th graders and college sophomores was deemed to be detrimental to the program. Therefore, after the 1982 quiz year, the rules changed to their current restriction on age and grade. Naturally, this had quite an impact on the program. Many teams in 1982 lost the services of their older quizzers and this changed the program forever.
* *1984 & 1985: 2nd Place Regional teams allowed to quiz*\
Participation at Nationals was expanded to include first and second place winners from each region. It had long been known that many of the better teams were not able to participate at Nationals since they lost their regional final. Therefore, to stimulate the growth of the program and to aid those better teams who otherwise wouldn't make it to Nationals, the top sixteen teams were allowed to participate. However, this wonderful idea was awkwardly implemented in 1984 and 1985. The sixteen teams were randomly placed into two eight-team brackets after which the top two teams from each would compete in a round-robin for the championship. Naturally, this caused multiple complaints as in each year one bracket was composed of the dominant teams.

## Expansion Era (1986 - 1999)

Starting in 1986, Bible Quiz National Finals underwent an expansion that would see it grow from 16 teams to 20 teams to 24 teams:
* ***1986 - 1992***: 16 teams were allowed to compete made up of the top two teams from each region. 17 teams were present in 1987 and 1992 due to extenuating circumstances.
* ***1993 - 1995***: 20 teams were allowed to compete made up of the top two teams from each region and the top four third place teams from a special tournament on the Monday of nationals.
* ***1996 - 1999***: 24 teams were allowed to compete. In 1996, the third place team from the Northwest region declined to compete, so there were only 23 teams.

As expansion continued, there was a need to recognize individual achievement beyond the top scorer trophy, especially for outstanding quizzers on very balanced teams (e.g., every quizzer is a high scoring quizzer). This, along with the difficulty during the odd years of 1984 & 1985 (top scorer couldn't be determined as it wasn't a round robin) led to the creation of the Individual Tournament in 1986. Initially, it was composed of the top 16 scorers and has since expanded significantly.

**Statistical Notes**:
* Eight-team round robin except for 1984 and 1985 where there were 16 teams in different divisions.

## Modern Era (2000+)

Starting in 2000, Bible Quiz National Finals has consisted of 40 teams, typically consisting of the top five teams from each region. If teams chose not to participate, wildcards are chosen to include lower placed teams (sixth- or even seventh-place teams have competed). On Monday, teams compete in multiple prelimary divisions for a spot in the Championship Division. The top 20 teams compete for the National Championship and the bottom 20 teams compete in the Challenger Division.

From 2000 to 2006, regional champions automatically got a slot in the Championship Division. The top three of eight teams in each preliminary division moved to the Championship Division. From 2007 on, all 40 teams have competed on Monday with the top five teams from each preliminary division moving to the Championship Division.

Naturally, with the most recent expansions, National Finals became more of a marathon than in the past. The eight team years certainly favored a team that was "hot" on a given day, while the modern formats require a great deal of mental and physical stamina. However, with the eight team format, one loss sometimes meant the championship and easier matches were few or or non-existent. An individual quizzer who had one difficult quiz in the modern era might easily recover in the remaining twenty plus rounds. Certainly quizzers have more rounds now to cover for a bad game and retain their average, but they must also keep up their level of quizzing over approximately 20 rounds and two to three days. There is no doubt that some quizzers from the modern era would do better in the previous formats, and vice-versa.

Below you will find various Bible Quiz Records. Comparing accomplishments from year-to-year can be quite a difficult task for several reasons, and comparisons between eras of quizzing is almost impossible for the purposes of claiming one team or one quizzer was provably better than another. Among those reasons are:

* different amounts material to memorize from year to year
* different question writers/styles
* varying levels of quality of competition
* interrupting questions was seldom done in the early years of competition
* varying formats of competition from year to year
* in the mid 1970's (we do not know the exact year), the rules were changed to increase the number of questions for a quiz-out from five to six
* in 1983, the rules were changed to no longer allow college students of quizzing age to participate
* in 2006, the rules were changed to five correct questions for a quiz-out with a 20 point bonus, with a max score of 150, resulting in the fact that it is easier to quiz out forward and there are more bonus points for quizzing out forward
* in 2006, with only five questions for a quiz-out, four quizzers could quiz-out each round for a total of 80 bonus points, rather than 3 quiz-outs with only 30 points total, changing the maximum score for one round from 380 points to 430 points.

With this understanding, we offer comparable data by category. Just as an Olympic champion is always an Olympic champion, and historical records are kept for each event, the following Bible Quiz records are kept to retain the history of the program and to allow everyone to see all of the accomplishments. Therefore, when listing ranks for one high score (etc.) over another, we are attempting to show the progression of the program and each individual or team accomplishment. Some of these accomplishments are phenomenally better than those before them, and might happen to be the best ever if we had the ability for the 50+ champions to all play each other at the same time, over the same material, at the same age and with the same questions, which we cannot do, and therefore, cannot prove. We ask that you take them as they are, and that each new generation of quizzers use them as inspiration to drive their learning of God's word.
The following data does not contain any information from preliminary rounds at National Finals or the Challenger Division. This is not meant to exclude teams; however, it is done out of fairness to the teams that quizzed before 2000 and those from 2000 - 2006 who were Regional Champions and did not have to play in the preliminary rounds. Further, to make the comparisons as viable as possible, scores from all years have been normalized. This normalization was done because until 2005, there were 380 points available per game, counting bonus points, and it took 6 questions to quiz out. From 2006 to the present, there are 430 points available because there are 80 bonus points available and quizzers need only 5 correct questions to quiz out. The formula for normalized points is 380/430*(points). Therefore, to help with comparisons, they are made based on percentage of total obtainable points scored. Since we do not know the exact year in the 1970s in which the number of questions for a quiz-out was changed from five to six, we have assumed it was six for all relevant years. This does not effect most records as we have very little data from that time period.



* From 1993 - 1995, there were 20 teams competing in a full round robin, which included the top two teams from each region, as well as 4 top teams from a 3rd place tourney held on Monday.
* In 1996, the field was increased to 24 teams (top 3 from each region); however, the third-place team from the Northwest declined to participate and was not replaced so only twenty-three teams participated.
* From 1997 - 1999, there were 24 teams competing in a full round robin, which included the top three teams from each region.
* From 2000 - 2006, there were 40 teams (5 from each region) competing at National Finals, with 32 teams (#2-5 from each region) competing on Monday so that the top 12 would join the Regional Champions starting Tuesday for a 20-team round robin for the National Championship, while the remaining 20 teams competed in what is called the "Challenger Bracket," which ultimate comprises teams in 21st through 40th place at National Finals.
* From 2007 - 2009 there were 40 teams (5 from each region) competing at National Finals, with all 40 playing in four brackets of 10 on Monday to determine the top 5 from each bracket that will comprise a top-20-team full round robin, with the remaining 20 teams competing in the "Challenger Bracket".
* Years with an asterisk (*) were the years when 16 teams went to National Finals, but they were divided into two groups of 8, played a 7-game round robin, then moved into playoffs - for these 2 years, their percentage was based on their combined 7-game round robin performance and playoff rounds - these two years as well as 2010 are the only years which include playoff rounds because without them it is impossible to have a full picture of their win-loss record. Several years of data are missing due to the fact that official scores were announced but not available via an official printout and we have yet to find scoresheets for these years.

Ties have not been broken, but have been sorted in reverse chronological order (the exception being for undefeated teams).
