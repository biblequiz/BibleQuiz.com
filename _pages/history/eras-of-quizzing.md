Bible Quiz began in the 1961-62 season covering the book of acts with District-level competition. Regional and National competitions weren't held until 1963. The history section has been divided into multiple eras.

## Single Elimination Era (1963 - 1965)

The first three National Finals (1963 - 1965) were single elimination events composed of the winners of each of the eight regions.

**Noteworthy Rules**:
* Quizzer could only answer five correct to quiz-out or answer-out.
* If a quizzer answered three incorrectly, a team was not allowed to replace that individual.
 
**Statistical Notes**:
* Top scorers were not officially announced until 1968 and the single elimination format makes determining a top scorer difficult. As a guideline, the top scorer from the winning team has been selected as the top scorer for the event.
* Due to the single elimination format, it is virtually impossible to compare the results of these years with those of other eras. However, the [records]({% link _pages/history/records.md %}) do include certain statistics such as winner and top scorers.
* Results from this incipient era are sparse, so these years may never fully be incorporated into the records.

## Eight Team Era (1966 - 1985)

From 1966 to 1985, Bible Quiz National Finals consisted of eight-team round-robins, which was a great advance for all the participants. Still, only the winners of each of the eight regions was allowed to participate.

**Noteworthy Rule Changes**:
* Error-out quizzers could be replaced.
* Quizzers were removed from active quiz after six correct answers.
* Addition of on-time points (10).
* Question writing rules made interrupting very difficult. For example, a question could contain the word "quote" without a declaration of it being scripture text.

**Noteworthy Years**:
* *1983: College-aged teenagers excluded from quizzing*\
Until this year, the rules stated that a quizzer could participate as long as they were not 19 in September of the beginning quiz year. This meant that certain individuals born in the last three months of the year could quiz a total of eight years (often in college in the extra one or two years). Concerns about the large gap in age between 7th graders and college sophomores was deemed to be detrimental to the program. Therefore, after the 1982 quiz year, the rules changed to their current restriction on age and grade. Naturally, this had quite an impact on the program. Many teams in 1982 lost the services of their older quizzers and this changed the program forever.
* *1984 & 1985: 2nd Place Regional teams allowed to quiz*\
Participation at Nationals was expanded to include first and second place winners from each region. It had long been known that many of the better teams were not able to participate at Nationals since they lost their regional final. Therefore, to stimulate the growth of the program and to aid those better teams who otherwise wouldn't make it to Nationals, the top sixteen teams were allowed to participate. However, this wonderful idea was awkwardly implemented in 1984 and 1985. The sixteen teams were randomly placed into two eight-team brackets after which the top two teams from each would compete in a round-robin for the championship. Naturally, this caused multiple complaints as in each year one bracket was composed of the dominant teams.

## Expansion Era (1986 - 1999)

Starting in 1986, Bible Quiz National Finals underwent an expansion that would see it grow from 16 teams to 20 teams to 24 teams and finally to 40 teams:
* ***1986 - 1992***: Top two teams from each region are allowed to compete. An extra team was allowed in 1987 and 1992 due to unusual circumstances.
* ***1993 - 1995***: The third place regional teams competed in a special tournament the Monday of nationals. The top four teams from that tournament joined the other 16 teams to compete for the championship.
* ***1996 - 1999***: 24 teams were allowed to compete. Wildcards were not done in these years, so only 23 teams competed in 1996.

## Modern Era (2000+)

Starting in 2000, Bible Quiz National Finals has consisted of 40 teams, typically consisting of the top five teams from each region. If teams chose not to participate, wildcards are chosen to include lower placed teams (sixth- or even seventh-place teams have competed). On Monday, teams compete in multiple prelimary divisions for a spot in the Championship Division. The top 20 teams compete for the National Championship and the bottom 20 teams compete in the Challenger Division.

From 2000 to 2006, regional champions automatically got a slot in the Championship Division. The top three of eight teams in each preliminary division moved to the Championship Division. From 2007 on, all 40 teams have competed on Monday with the top five teams from each preliminary division moving to the Championship Division.

Welcome to the Bible Quiz Records section. To view these you may select the link below. Before you browse through these incredible accomplishments it is necessary to give a background on the various eras within Bible Quiz as they affect the outcome of nearly all records. Additionally, the records for which we do not have complete data will contain a caveat which contain the appropriate details.

1963-1965
Our introduction to the eras of Bible Quiz begins with the origins of National Finals in 1963. The first three National Finals (1963-1965) were single elimination events composed of the winners of each of the eight regions. Some rules which affected the outcome of the records include the fact that a quizzer could only answer five correct to quiz-out or answer-out. Also, if a quizzer answered three incorrectly, a team was not allowed to replace that individual. Top scorers were not officially announced until 1968 and it would be very difficult to determine a top scorer since the format was single elimination. However, as a guideline, we have used the top scorer from the winning team as the top scorer for the event. Finally, results and scores from this incipient era are difficult to come by meaning we may never be able to fully incorporate these years into the records. Of course, due to the single elimination format, it is virtually impossible to compare the results of these years with those of other eras. However, we can use items such as the winners, participants, and "top-scorers" from this era within the records section.

1966-1983
The second era of Bible Quiz covers the years from 1966-1983 inclusive with a special note about 1983. First, due to the scarcity of results and scores for the years 1966-1972 it will be difficult to incorporate those into the records. Fortunately, for most of the remaining years and to the present, we have nearly complete round by round data for National Finals. During this era changes in rules occurred such as the ability to replace an error-out quizzer, answering-out with six correct, and on-time points (10). All of these affect our records. Nationals began to use the round-robin format which was a great advance for all the participants. Still, only the winners of each of the eight regions was allowed to participate. Also, rules for writing questions were somewhat vague making it very difficult to interrupt them. For example, a question could contain the word "quote" without a declaration of it being scripture text.

The rules regarding participants changed drastically in 1983. Until this year, the rules stated that a quizzer could participate as long as they were not 19 in September of the beginning quiz year. This meant that certain individuals born in the last three months of the year could quiz a total of eight years. Those quizzers who participated in the extra one or two years were often in college at the time. The national office was concerned about the large gap in age with 7th graders competing against college sophomores. This, along with the restriction of only the winners from the eight regions participating in National Finals, was deemed to be detrimental to the program. Therfore, after the 1982 quiz year, the rules changed to their current restriction on age and grade. Naturally, this had quite an impact on the program. Many teams in 1982 lost the services of their older quizzers and this changed the program forever.

1984-1985
A third, short-lived era of quiz unfolded in 1984 and 1985. After changing the age rules to encourage participation of younger quizzers, the national office decided upon expanding the participation at Nationals to include first and second place winners from each region. It had long been known that many of the better teams were not able to participate at Nationals since they lost their regional final. Therefore, to stimulate the growth of the program and to aid those better teams who otherwise wouldn't make it to Nationals, the national office allowed the top sixteen teams to participate. However, this wonderful idea was awkwardly implemented in 1984 and 1985. The sixteen teams were randomly placed into two eight-team brackets after which the top two teams from each would compete in a round-robin for the championship. Naturally, this caused multiple complaints as in each year one bracket was composed of the dominant teams.

1986-Current
1986 begins our modern era of quizzing. Many changes were made to Bible Quiz program at this time and within this era. Although changes have continued from 1986 to the present, the one constant has been that National Finals became a true round-robin event. At first (1986-92) it was composed of the first and second place winners from each region (16 teams). This participation was later expanded (1993) to include a third place tournament where all the third place regional teams competed in a round-robin the day before the actual National Finals round-robin. The top four teams from the third place tournament went on to quiz with the top two teams from each region to create a 20-team round robin. Full expansion to the top three teams from each region, 24 teams total, came about in 1996. All of this leading to our current expansion (2000) of accepting the top five teams from each Regional Final to National Finals. National Finals is now composed of two divisions (Championship and Challenger). Each bracket will play a full round-robin, but the national champion is the winner of the Championship bracket. The top team from each regional final receives a "bye" into the Championship bracket, while the remaining 32 teams play in four brackets of eight teams each to determine the remaining twelve teams for the Championship group. The 20 teams not qualifying for the Championship group will play in the Challenger bracket.

Summary
Other changes which affect our records include the introduction of the individual tournament (one-on-one) in 1986. Once expansion occurred in 1984, the leadership determined that there was a need to recognize individual achievement beyond the top scorer trophy. This was because an expanded format meant that it was more difficult to determine the top quizzers and the leadership wanted to recognize outstanding quizzers on very balanced teams. This, along with the difficulty in the odd years (84-85) to determine a top scorer since it wasn't round-robin, caused the creation of the individual tourney. At first, this tournament was composed of the top 16 scorers. Now it has expanded to include several times that amount. However, it was reformatted in 1999 to exist as a one-on-five competition, and this format seems to be the trend of the future.

Naturally, with the most recent expansions, National Finals became more of a marathon than in the past. The eight team years certainly favored a team that was "hot" on a given day, while the modern formats require a great deal of mental and physical stamina. However, with the eight team format, one loss sometimes meant the championship and easier matches were few or or non-existent. An individual quizzer who had one difficult quiz in the modern era might easily recover in the remaining twenty plus rounds. Certainly quizzers have more rounds now to cover for a bad game and retain their average, but they must also keep up their level of quizzing over approximately 20 rounds and two to three days. There is no doubt that some quizzers from the modern era would do better in the previous formats, and vice-versa. Ultimately the records are what they are and do not make for perfect comparisons. All of these eras have differences which affect the outcome of our records. However, the purpose of this section of the website is not comparison, rather the celebration of team and individual achievement in quizzing.

Below you will find various Bible Quiz Records. Comparing accomplishments from year-to-year can be quite a difficult task for several reasons, and comparisons between eras of quizzing is almost impossible for the purposes of claiming one team or one quizzer was provably better than another. Among those reasons are:

* different amounts material to memorize from year to year
* different question writers/styles
* varying levels of quality of competition
* interrupting questions was seldom done in the early years of competition
* varying formats of competition from year to year
* in the mid 1970's (we do not know the exact year), the rules were changed to increase the number of questions for a quiz-out from five to six
* in 1983, the rules were changed to no longer allow college students of quizzing age to participate
* in 2006, the rules were changed to five correct questions for a quiz-out with a 20 point bonus, with a max score of 150, resulting in the fact that it is easier to quiz out forward and there are more bonus points for quizzing out forward
* in 2006, with only five questions for a quiz-out, four quizzers could quiz-out each round for a total of 80 bonus points, rather than 3 quiz-outs with only 30 points total, changing the maximum score for one round from 380 points to 430 points.

With this understanding, we offer comparable data by category. Just as an Olympic champion is always an Olympic champion, and historical records are kept for each event, the following Bible Quiz records are kept to retain the history of the program and to allow everyone to see all of the accomplishments. Therefore, when listing ranks for one high score (etc.) over another, we are attempting to show the progression of the program and each individual or team accomplishment. Some of these accomplishments are phenomenally better than those before them, and might happen to be the best ever if we had the ability for the 50+ champions to all play each other at the same time, over the same material, at the same age and with the same questions, which we cannot do, and therefore, cannot prove. We ask that you take them as they are, and that each new generation of quizzers use them as inspiration to drive their learning of God's word.
The following data does not contain any information from preliminary rounds at National Finals or the Challenger Division. This is not meant to exclude teams; however, it is done out of fairness to the teams that quizzed before 2000 and those from 2000 - 2006 who were Regional Champions and did not have to play in the preliminary rounds. Further, to make the comparisons as viable as possible, scores from all years have been normalized. This normalization was done because until 2005, there were 380 points available per game, counting bonus points, and it took 6 questions to quiz out. From 2006 to the present, there are 430 points available because there are 80 bonus points available and quizzers need only 5 correct questions to quiz out. The formula for normalized points is 380/430*(points). Therefore, to help with comparisons, they are made based on percentage of total obtainable points scored. Since we do not know the exact year in the 1970s in which the number of questions for a quiz-out was changed from five to six, we have assumed it was six for all relevant years. This does not effect most records as we have very little data from that time period.
