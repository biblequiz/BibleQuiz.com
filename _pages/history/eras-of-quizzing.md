Bible Quiz began in 1961-62 covering the book of Acts. District competitions took place that year, but it was not until 1963 that Regional and National competitions were held. We have divided the history section into four "eras". 1963 to 1965 is the "single-elimination era". Eight teams played a single-elimination tournament. 1966 to 1985 is the "eight-team era". Eight teams played a full round-robin. 1983 had eight teams playing a full round-robin, however this was the first year that college-aged teenagers were not allowed to quiz. Also in 1984 and 1985, while sixteen teams competed, they only played in two divisions of eight. Therefore these years are included in this era. 1986 to 1999 is the "expansion era". In this time period, the number of teams allowed to compete went from 16 to 20 to 24. 2000 to the present is the "modern era". In this time period, 40 teams were allowed to compete and there was a championship and challenger division. Statistics, photos, and other memorabilia from previous National Bible Quiz Finals can be viewed by selecting the appropriate era from the images below. You may also view historical lists that span every year of Bible Quiz history. We also have a "biographies" section where you may view information about top quizzers, coaches, teams, writers and national coordinators. The history section is an ongoing project that will never be complete. We need your help in filling out the empty spaces.

## 1963 - 1965: Single Elimination Era

The first three National Finals (1963-1965) were single elimination events composed of the winners of each of the eight regions. Some rules which affected the outcome of the records include the fact that a quizzer could only answer five correct to quiz-out or answer-out. Also, if a quizzer answered three incorrectly, a team was not allowed to replace that individual. Top scorers were not officially announced until 1968 and it would be very difficult to determine a top scorer since the format was single elimination. However, as a guideline, we have used the top scorer from the winning team as the top scorer for the event. Finally, results and scores from this incipient era are difficult to come by meaning we may never be able to fully incorporate these years into the records. Of course, due to the single elimination format, it is virtually impossible to compare the results of these years with those of other eras. However, we can use items such as the winners, participants, and "top-scorers" from this era within the records section. Below are images of Scripture Portions or Study Guides for these quiz years. Statistics, photos, and other memorabilia from these National Bible Quiz Finals can be viewed by selecting the appropriate year. We are missing round-scores for 1965.

## 1966 - 1985: Eight Team Era

From 1966 to 1985, Bible Quiz National Finals consisted of eight-team round-robins. During this era changes in rules occurred such as the ability to replace an error-out quizzer, answering-out with six correct, and on-time points (10). All of these affect our records. Nationals began to use the round-robin format which was a great advance for all the participants. Still, only the winners of each of the eight regions was allowed to participate. Also, rules for writing questions were somewhat vague making it very difficult to interrupt them. For example, a question could contain the word "quote" without a declaration of it being scripture text. The rules regarding participants changed drastically in 1983. Until this year, the rules stated that a quizzer could participate as long as they were not 19 in September of the beginning quiz year. This meant that certain individuals born in the last three months of the year could quiz a total of eight years. Those quizzers who participated in the extra one or two years were often in college at the time. The national office was concerned about the large gap in age with 7th graders competing against college sophomores. This, along with the restriction of only the winners from the eight regions participating in National Finals, was deemed to be detrimental to the program. Therefore, after the 1982 quiz year, the rules changed to their current restriction on age and grade. Naturally, this had quite an impact on the program. Many teams in 1982 lost the services of their older quizzers and this changed the program forever. After changing the age rules to encourage participation of younger quizzers, the national office decided upon expanding the participation at Nationals to include first and second place winners from each region. It had long been known that many of the better teams were not able to participate at Nationals since they lost their regional final. Therefore, to stimulate the growth of the program and to aid those better teams who otherwise wouldn't make it to Nationals, the national office allowed the top sixteen teams to participate. However, this wonderful idea was awkwardly implemented in 1984 and 1985. The sixteen teams were randomly placed into two eight-team brackets after which the top two teams from each would compete in a round-robin for the championship. Naturally, this caused multiple complaints as in each year one bracket was composed of the dominant teams. Below are images of Scripture Portions or Study Guides for these quiz years. Statistics, photos, and other memorabilia from these National Bible Quiz Finals can be viewed by selecting the appropriate year. We are missing round-by-round results for 1966 to 1974 and 1977.

## 1986 - 1999: Expansion Era

Starting in 1986, Bible Quiz National Finals underwent an expansion that would see it grow from 16 teams to 20 teams to 24 teams and finally to 40 teams. From 1986 to 1992 only the top two teams were allowed to participate with an extra team allowed to compete in 1987 and 1992 due to unusual circumstances. From 1993 to 1995, third place teams competed in a special tournament the Monday of nationals. The top four teams from that tournament joined the other 16 teams to compete for the championship. From 1996 to 1999, 24 teams were allowed to compete. Wild-cards were not done in these years, so in 1996, only 23 teams competed. Below are images of Scripture Portions or Study Guides for these quiz years. Statistics, photos, and other memorabilia from these National Bible Quiz Finals can be viewed by selecting the appropriate year. We are missing round-by-round results for 1989, 1992-1995 and 1997. If you have these results, please e-mail biblequiz@me.com.

## 2000+: Modern Era

Starting in 2000, Bible Quiz National Finals has consisted of 40 teams. These are usually the top five teams from each region, however, if teams choose not to participate, wild-cards are chosen so that sometimes sixth- or even seventh-place teams have competed. On Monday, teams compete in four divisions for a spot in the Championship Division. The top 20 teams compete for the National Championship and the bottom 20 teams compete in the Challenger Division. From 2000 to 2006, regional champions automatically got a slot in the Championship Division, therefore the top three of eight teams in each group moved on to the Championship Division. From 2007 on, all 40 teams have competed on Monday so that the top five teams from each group move on. Below are images of Scripture Portions for these quiz years. Statistics, photos, and other memorabilia from these National Bible Quiz Finals can be viewed by selecting the appropriate year. We are missing preliminary round-by-round results for several of these years as well as all round-by-round results for 2003. If you have these results, please e-mail biblequiz@me.com.
