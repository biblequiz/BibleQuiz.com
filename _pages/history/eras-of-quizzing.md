Bible Quiz began in the 1961-62 season covering the book of acts with District-level competition. Regional and National competitions weren't held until 1963. The history section has been divided into multiple eras.

## Single Elimination Era (1963 - 1965)

The first three National Finals (1963 - 1965) were single elimination events composed of the winners of each of the eight regions.

**Noteworthy Rules**:
* Quizzer could only answer five correct to quiz-out or answer-out.
* If a quizzer answered three incorrectly, a team was not allowed to replace that individual.
 
**Statistical Notes**:
* Top scorers were not officially announced until 1968 and the single elimination format makes determining a top scorer difficult. As a guideline, the top scorer from the winning team has been selected as the top scorer for the event.
* Due to the single elimination format, it is virtually impossible to compare the results of these years with those of other eras. However, the [records]({% link _pages/history/records.md %}) do include certain statistics such as winner and top scorers.
* Results from this incipient era are sparse, so these years may never fully be incorporated into the records.

## Eight Team Era (1966 - 1985)

From 1966 to 1985, Bible Quiz National Finals consisted of eight-team round-robins, which was a great advance for all the participants. Still, only the winners of each of the eight regions was allowed to participate.

**Noteworthy Rule Changes**:
* Error-out quizzers could be replaced.
* Quizzers were removed from active quiz after six correct answers.
* Addition of on-time points (10).
* Question writing rules made interrupting very difficult. For example, a question could contain the word "quote" without a declaration of it being scripture text.

**Noteworthy Years**:
* *1983: College-aged teenagers excluded from quizzing*\
Until this year, the rules stated that a quizzer could participate as long as they were not 19 in September of the beginning quiz year. This meant that certain individuals born in the last three months of the year could quiz a total of eight years (often in college in the extra one or two years). Concerns about the large gap in age between 7th graders and college sophomores was deemed to be detrimental to the program. Therefore, after the 1982 quiz year, the rules changed to their current restriction on age and grade. Naturally, this had quite an impact on the program. Many teams in 1982 lost the services of their older quizzers and this changed the program forever.
* *1984 & 1985: 2nd Place Regional teams allowed to quiz*\
Participation at Nationals was expanded to include first and second place winners from each region. It had long been known that many of the better teams were not able to participate at Nationals since they lost their regional final. Therefore, to stimulate the growth of the program and to aid those better teams who otherwise wouldn't make it to Nationals, the top sixteen teams were allowed to participate. However, this wonderful idea was awkwardly implemented in 1984 and 1985. The sixteen teams were randomly placed into two eight-team brackets after which the top two teams from each would compete in a round-robin for the championship. Naturally, this caused multiple complaints as in each year one bracket was composed of the dominant teams.

## Expansion Era (1986 - 1999)

Starting in 1986, Bible Quiz National Finals underwent an expansion that would see it grow from 16 teams to 20 teams to 24 teams and finally to 40 teams:
* ***1986 - 1992***: Top two teams from each region are allowed to compete. An extra team was allowed in 1987 and 1992 due to unusual circumstances.
* ***1993 - 1995***: The third place regional teams competed in a special tournament the Monday of nationals. The top four teams from that tournament joined the other 16 teams to compete for the championship.
* ***1996 - 1999***: 24 teams were allowed to compete. Wildcards were not done in these years, so only 23 teams competed in 1996.

## Modern Era (2000+)

Starting in 2000, Bible Quiz National Finals has consisted of 40 teams, typically consisting of the top five teams from each region. If teams chose not to participate, wildcards are chosen to include lower placed teams (sixth- or even seventh-place teams have competed). On Monday, teams compete in multiple prelimary divisions for a spot in the Championship Division. The top 20 teams compete for the National Championship and the bottom 20 teams compete in the Challenger Division.

From 2000 to 2006, regional champions automatically got a slot in the Championship Division. The top three of eight teams in each preliminary division moved to the Championship Division. From 2007 on, all 40 teams have competed on Monday with the top five teams from each preliminary division moving to the Championship Division.
