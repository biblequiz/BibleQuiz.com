Point totals were done by hand, so nothing was distributed to the teams, but Orange Hills Assembly, Orange, CA went undefeated at District Finals.
David Dorey was the high scorer for the day in official play, with Ricky Haney finishing a close third to the top scorer from the second place team (Jonathan Falkey of Santa Ana).  Orange and Santa Ana will represent the Southern California District at Regional Finals in Colorado Springs.
