Going into the final two rounds there were six teams, all within one game of each other, vying for first place. What was more incredible was that in the remaining two rounds
each of these teams had to play two of the others they were tied with. However, the most amazing feat was performed by Radiant Church of Colorado Springs, CO. After losing the
first two rounds of the tournament, Radiant proceeded to win every single game, beating all of the top teams and sealing a playoff spot for first - in which they soundly defeated
their opponents. All this in the face of the most challenging (and I am being really nice in my selection of that word) questions I have seen all year. This was the closest
tournament finish I have ever seen based on win-loss records and quality of quizzing.
