The tournament began with 20 teams in both divisions. On Friday night, seeding rounds were held to determine the 12 teams that would compete in the A-league and the 8
teams that would compete in the B-league. On Saturday, team competition took place in each division respectively. One interesting event happened in the second round of the
three-way playoff, in the match between Cedar Park, Texas Trinity #1 and Overland Park, Kansas Adat Yeshua. On the fourth question of the match, the power suddenly went out,
forcing second and third to be decided by total points.
