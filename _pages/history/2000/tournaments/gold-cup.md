## Memories

This was the most awesome playoff I have ever seen. To start out ...

Braeswood (the 8th seed) beat the 1st seed (Trinity Church) in the most exciting, and close, match I witnessed. Next, Central knocked out
Las Vegas while Orange eliminated Tulsa. The final battle between Orange and Central was one of the best quizzes I have seen in a long time.
Both team knew their material, but at the start I was sure that Central was going to win since
their team was not only intact from last year, but they had picked up the top quizzer from the old Parkcrest team. I
should have remembered that on a short book anything can happen. When Joey Bohanon quizzed out backwards with 1
right and 3 wrong, the remaining quizzers were in a friendly knock-down-drag-out. True to form, after the
championship both Central and Orange left the game in the room and went out to dinner together. No one was interested in talking
about quiz - we wanted to catch up on old times and have fun. Even though we had spent a
great deal of time with Central at national finals, we couldn't wait to continue our close friendship. I would certainly say that teams need to watch out for
Central - they have three great quizzers and are looking to make this coming nationals their own. I am sure many of you will
have something to say about that at the quiz table, but suffice it to say that they are totally excited, totally committed, and totally interested in having the right motivation.

As for Orange, Ricky, David, and Tim proved they can fully compete on their own without Kent. Their average for the day was lower than a couple other teams, but
they came through in every game, being undefeated for the entire tournament - although they weren't have enjoying the margin
of victory they had last year. After seeing all the great teams at this tournament I am looking forward to a great national finals.
