The tournament begins with two evenly divided groups of 13 teams (Gold and Blue Divisions). These two groups of 13 play a round-robin within their own division. The top two from each
division go on to a three-game round robin playoff. Below fourth place, the team rankings go by win-loss records within their own division, and then total points scored.
Individual ties were broken by quiz-outs.
