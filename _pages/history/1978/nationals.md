The 16th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 13-15, 1978 in Kansas City, Missouri covering the books of I and II Corinthians. Terry Carter was the National Coordinator and Steve Sorensen was the official question writer.

The event was won by Evangel Temple A/G, Decatur, GA which became one of a very select few champions to win Nationals with an undefeated record. The second place team was Calvary Temple A/G, Riverside, CA which began a streak of three consecutive years of finishing in second place at National Finals.

The team from Decatur was the same church which had won National Finals in 1976 and in 1963 (the church simply changed names and locations after 1963). Therefore, this team became the very first church to win 3 National Championships. First A/G, New Orleans, LA would duplicate this feat in 1984 as would Orange Hills A/G, Orange, CA in 2003 and The Church at Briargate, Colorado Springs, CO in 2006 (they also won in 2007).

Additionally, Decatur team captain Ronnie Wright earned top quizzer honors and became the second of what would be 4 different top quizzers at National Finals from this church. Rhett Laurens of Decatur also placed in the top 6 quizzers and this was the first of 4 National Finals in which he would place among the top 6 - a record that would not be equaled until 2006, by Jon Galliers. Decatur also established records for points scored and margin of victory. In placing an undefeated record, they had no opponent with a record better than 4 wins and 3 losses - highly unusual during the 8 team era.

Complete records for this event, including round by round scores and top quizzers, are available on this site. To view a larger image of the program cover, please select the image at left. An audio cassette of the entire awards ceremony from 1978, including the all-star quiz, will be made available online within the memories section shortly.
