The 45th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 8-13, 2007 in Tucson, AZ at the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort covering the Acts of the Apostles. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Richard Ely was the official question writer. This was the last of three years in which Richard wrote questions.

The championship division was won by The Church at Briargate #1, Colorado Springs, CO. This was the same church that won nationals in 2001, 2004 and 2006. Coach Greg House won his fifth national title, the others being in 1993, 1999, 2003 and 2006. This was also a back-to-back championship for quizzers Andrew Kelley and Michael Rose. The second place team was the 2005 national champion, Cedar Park A/G, Bothell, WA coached by 1981 national champion Kari Brodin. Both Briargate and Bothell had a 17-2 record. Briargate won the energetic playoff match on the last question. A video of this match is embedded in the memories section. The third place team was James River A/G, Ozark, MO. While there are several instances of teams winning nationals back-to-back, this is the first time that the first, second and third place teams have been identical to the previous year. The challenger division was won by First A/G, Binghamton, NY.

This marks the eighteenth overall year in which the Southwest region has won nationals.

The top scorer at the 2007 National Finals was Jared Burkhalter from Faith A/G, Orlando, FL. Jared's per quiz average was 105.53. A new rulebook in 2006 made it five questions for a quiz-out with a 20 point bonus, so it is a little difficult to compare that to previous years.

The individual tournament was won by Jenna-Jo Duffy of Bothell, WA. The quoting bee was won by Joshua Wagner of Owasso, OK. Joshua also won the quoting bee in 2008. The west won their ninth east-west quiz. The boys won the boy-girl quiz.

### Individuals

Perfect games were achieved by only two quizzers. Lucas Cox got one in the championship division and LaJoie Ward got one in the challenger division. The Top Quizzers from the 2007 National Bible Quiz Tournament for both divisions are listed below. Each participant is listed with statistics. If possible, ties are broken by number of quiz-outs. The standings below show a tie for fourth place being broken in Josh Wagner's favor. This award actually goes to Jesse Czubkowski due to an error in his number of forward quiz-outs.

### Videos

#### Playoff

Below is a video recorded by Jeff Sharkey of the playoff match between Briargate and Bothell. The raw video was almost an hour long, so to save space, time outs, confers, preparation time on contests and the officials' discussion on contests have been eliminated. Midway through the match you can see Andrew Kelley give his famous "Point of Order, may I blow my nose".
