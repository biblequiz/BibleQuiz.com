The 35th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 4-8, 1997 in Indianapolis, Indiana covering the gospel of Matthew. Rich Percifield was the National Coordinator and Dan Smith was the official question writer.

This was also the second of four years in which 24 teams were invited to participate and where all teams play in a full round-robin.

The national championship was won by First A/G, Lexington, KY. There was a four-way tie for second place. Emerging victorious from the playoffs was Central A/G, Springfield, MO. The third place team was Victorious Life, Waco, TX.

This marked the fourth overall year in which the Great Lakes region has won nationals.

The top scorers at the 1997 National Finals were Kent Piacenti of Life Community Church, Sunnyvale, TX and Jeremy Horn of First A/G, Shreveport, LA (although Jeremy did have more quiz-outs). Their per quiz average of 104.57. To date, this is the only tie for top scorer at nationals. Kent would go on to be top scorer in 1998 and 1999, increasing his average by 30 points in 1998 and another 20 points in 1999. Jeremy Horn won the individual tournament as well. This was the first time since Marcae Johson in 1988 when the top scorer won the individual tournament. Piacenti would duplicate this result in 1998 and 1999.

Jeremy Horn won the scholarship quiz at the banquet. Participants in the quiz included the top quizzers from the 1st and 2nd place teams, the top quizzer overall and the winner of the one-on-one. Joey Bohanon, David Rees and Kent Piacenti finished second, third and fourth, respectively.
