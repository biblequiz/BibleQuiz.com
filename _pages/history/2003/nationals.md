The 41st National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 6-11, 2003 in Houston, TX at Braeswood Assembly of God covering the gospel of John. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Mel Aou, Kent Piacenti and Tim Bahra were the official question writers. This was the fourth year in which the official writing team wrote questions.

This was also the fourth year in which 40 teams were invited to participate. On the first day, the second through fifth place teams from each region competed in four separate divisions. The top three in each division joined the eight regional champions in the championship division. The other twenty teams played each other in the challenger division.

The championship division was won by Orange Hills Assembly of God, Orange, CA. The second place team was First A/G, San Angelo, TX. The third place team was Monroeville A/G, Monroeville, PA. The challenger division was won by Christian Chapel A/G, Tulsa, OK following a four-way playoff with The Church at Briargate, Colorado Springs, CO, Calvary A/G, Toledo, OH and Tacoma Life Center, Tacoma, WA.

This marks the fourth consecutive and fourteenth overall year in which the Southwest region has won nationals. This was also the last of three national championships for Orange Hills. They also won in 1999 and 2002. As in 1999 and 2002, this team was undefeated, a feat accomplished by only one other team since expansion (Owasso, OK in 2008). Coach Greg House also coached the 1993 and 1999 championship teams and would go on to coach the 2006 and 2007 championship teams. David Dorey was on the 1999 championship team and Peter Brown and David Dorey were on the 2002 championship team. Dorey was also on the championship team in 2004. This also marked the second time John Sullivan coached the second place team, the other time being in 1998.

The top scorer at the 2003 National Finals was Zach Sullivan from San Angelo, TX. Zach per-quiz average was 105.79. Finishing only five points behind Zach was David Dorey of Orange, CA. David also had 17 quiz outs.

The individual tournament was won by Peter Brown of Orange, CA. This was the seventh time the individual tournament was won by a member of the national championship team. The quoting bee was won by Jed Gosnell of Tacoma, WA. The west won their fifth consecutive east-west quiz.
