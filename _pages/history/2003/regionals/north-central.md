come all the way back to claim a 20 point lead with one question left. Cedar Rapids took the last question with 10 bonus points for the quiz-out to force a tie.
This left a one-question winner take all overtime question for the last place at Nationals. Cedar Rapids prevailed in the overtime to claim a 140-125 win, and 5th place in the Region.
