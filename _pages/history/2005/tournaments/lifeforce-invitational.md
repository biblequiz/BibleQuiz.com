### Final Awards

We played a final round to "combine" the Salt and Light groups, but unfortunately,
I made a mistake and did not have the right teams playing for the Championship.  I
discussed the situation with the coaches and the official stats people, and then I
decided to award the trophies as follows based on both the round robin results and
the final round results:

1. Merrillville Living Hope *AND* Indy Lakeview #1
2. Elkhart Calvary Pearls
3. Alfordsville
4. Anderson Faith #1
5. Indy Calvary Temple

**NOTE**: Munster Calvary Community had to leave before the final round, so Anderson
Faith #1 represented them from the Salt Group.
