The 43rd National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 10-15, 2005 in Phoenixville, PA at Valley Forge Christian College covering the gospel of Matthew. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Richard Ely was the official question writer.

This was the sixth year in which 40 teams were invited to participate. On the first day, the second through fifth place teams from each region competed in four separate divisions. The top three in each division joined the eight regional champions in the championship division. The other twenty teams played each other in the challenger division. It was also the last year in which quizzers needed six questions to get a quiz-out.

The championship division was won in a playoff by Cedar Park A/G, Bothell, WA (pictured). The second place team was First A/G, Lexington, KY. This was the first playoff for first place since 1995. The third place team was James River A/G, Ozark, MO. The challenger division was won by Grace A/G, Spring City, PA

This was only the second year in which the Northwest region has won nationals. The last time they won was in 1981 when Kari Brodin, coach of Bothell's second team this year, quizzed for Renton, WA. This was also the first time since 1995 that there was a playoff for first place. Bothell (and quizzer Brandon Duffy) would go on to four straight second place finishes from 2006 to 2009. This was also the first of four years in which a team from James River would be third place.

The top scorer at the 2005 National Finals was Jon Galliers from Lexington, KY. Jon's per-quiz average was 97.89 points. Jon was also the high scorer the following year.

The individual tournament was won by Jared Paige of Houston, TX. The quoting bee was won by Ariel Brookbank of Overland Park, KS. Beginning in 2003, quizzers who placed high enough at regionals were allowed to compete in the individual competion and quoting bee even if their team did not make it. Ariel was the first such quizzer to win one of these events. The west won their sixth consecutive east-west quiz.
