The 22nd National Bible Quiz Finals took place in the summer of 1984 in Springfield, Missouri covering the epistles of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians. Rex Bornman was the National Coordinator and Dale and David Baird were the official question writers.

This was the first year in which a sixteen teams were invited to participate, however, they did not play a full round robin. The sixteen teams were split into two brackets and played an 8-team round robin. At the end, the top two teams moved on to a "Final Four" playoff where four teams played a full round-robin.

The event was won by First A/G, New Orleans, LA. There was a three-way tie for first place. Earning second place was Byesville A/G, Byesville, OH. The other team involved in the playoff was also from the Gulf region, Evangel Temple, Springfield, MO. The other "Final Four" team from Ypsilanti A/G, Ypsilanti, MI would go on to win the 1985 National Finals which had the same format. Note that all four teams in this playoff were either from the Great Lakes or Gulf regions.

This was second consecutive win for New Orleans. This was also the same team that won in 1971, but is not the same team that won in 1979, also from New Orleans.

The top scorer at the 1984 National Finals was John Wootton of Byesville, OH. John was also the top scorer in 1983. Jennifer Curtis of Springfield, MO was second and Kevin DeWeber of Sandy, UT was third.
