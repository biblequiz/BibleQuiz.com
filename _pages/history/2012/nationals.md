The 50th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 1 - 5, 2012 in Columbus, Ohio at the Hyatt Regency Hotel covering Hebrews, 1 & 2 Peter and Jude. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Seth Sundell was the official question writer.

The national championship was won by Owasso First A/G, Owasso, OK (pictured). This was Owasso's fourth national championship, the other three being in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Owasso also won the round robin in 2010 however came in second following the Final Four playoffs. This was the fifth win for the state of Oklahoma (the other being in 1982) and the seventh win for the South Central region. Owasso is now the second team to win four national championships, the other being The Church at Briarage from Colorado Springs, CO (2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007).

This was the third year the Final Four format was used to determine the national champion. Coming in second place in the Final Four playoff was Wesley Chapel, FL. Third place went to Garfield, NJ and fourth place went to James River A/G, Ozark, MO. All four of these teams have histories of doing well at national finals. Wesley Chapel, who won the round robin with an 18-1 record (only the fourth team to do so) won national finals in 2010 and finished third in 2011. Garfield finished second in the round robin in 2010 and won the round robin in 2011, placing second in the Final Four. James River has had teams finish in the top 5 every year since 2005.

The challenger division was won by Newport Mesa A/G, Costa Mesa, CA.

The top scorer at the 2012 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the fourth consecutive and seventh overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). Abby was also top quizzer in 2010 and 2011. This makes her only the second person to be high scorer three times, much less three consecutive years (the other being Kent Piacenti from 1997 to 1999). Abby's per quiz average was 126.32. Second high scorer was Daniel Wagner from Owasso, OK. Joseph Chacra from Mt. Pocono, PA placed third. Rounding out the top five were Kyler Sederwall from Garfield, NJ and Joshua George from Ozark, MO.

The individual tournament was won by Abby Rogers, her second win. Daniel, Kyler and Abby battled for the title of quoting bee champion during the banquet and finished in that order.

The east-west took place on Wednesday afternoon and the East won. In addition, an unofficial quiz, dubbed the "Match of Death", with very hard, unusual and funny questions took place after the banquet eight top quizzers. We will be uploading the set soon, but the entire match is available in the "Memories" section.

The invitational national one-on-one was won by Courtney Walin. Results from this competition may be seen here.

Much was made of this being the 50th national finals. Special speakers included Bible Quiz founder Owen Carr and former top scorer John Wootton. In addition, George Edgerly and Bernie Elliot were given plaques to honor their many years of service to the Bible Quiz ministry.

* **Quizzer History**:

  * Brianna: 5 years in TBQ & this is her 3rd Nationals. She earned her NMA and Discipleship Award. She also earned her first ever MMA this year!
  * Aaron: 2nd year in TBQ and his first as an A League quizzer, so this is his first trip to Nationals. He was successful in completing all of the requirements for the NMA, MMA, and Discipleship Award this year.
  * Kendall: Quizzed in the A League for 4 years and finished everything needed to earn the Discipleship Award this season.
  * Marshall: He did TBQ for 6 years, but can't be at Nats with us this year since he was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point !!! Sadly (?) , he will be at boot camp while we're in Columbus...
* **Team History**\
We have advanced to National competition every year since we began an A League at our church, making this our 6th consecutive trip. We believe that we made Bible Quiz history during the GEPCP season by being the only team to ever win a 6-way playoff to qualify for the Championship Division. Fun times in Green Bay! (Editor's Note: That is correct. In fact, it's the only 6-way tie I've ever heard of that had to be broken). While we are thrilled that we get to be the host state for the 50th Celebration, our favorite trip was to Tucson. Nothing yet has beat the ping pong table by the pool!
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Our team's favorite match this season was when we pulled the win against Garfield at the 3 Rivers Tournament. GO, BRIANNA, GO !!!
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Aaron enjoyed Kyler's "Rahab rebuttal" at Pre-Nats. Apparently you just had to be there...
* **Favorite question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Unanimous: The "Zelda 2" question:\
Question Number for 20 Points. Statement and Two Part Quotation Question.\
One of the most unusual lines from the video game Zelda II is, quote, "I am Error," end-quote.\
Quote the verse that mentions those who lived in error and the verse that mentions being carried away by error.
* **Favorite verse from the material**\
The verse from which our team name is derived: Jude 9.
* **Tournaments attended this year**
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * [Gobblefest]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/gobblefest.md %})
  * Michiana
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
  * Three Rivers Classic
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
Best moments are generally centered around practice sessions, card games, and food! Good times had this year at Pat's, Lambert's, and Primanti Brothers! Our saddest moment this season occurred when Kendall's i-pod decided to run away down the Rocky steps...
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
The things we worked on for Discipleship truly produced fruit. After reading the book, Do Hard Things, our pastor, Scott Estep, decided to put the book in the hands of the entire coaching staff of the BGSU football team, of which he is the chaplain. Only God will know the full extent of that move! Even more exciting is this: While working on his Discipleship requirements, one of our middle school quizzers led his birth dad to the Lord! Our team also continued our tradition of reading God's Word aloud from the steps of the Wood County Courthouse in conjunction with the National Day of Prayer. We generally do this on a Wednesday afternoon, but this year we went to read twice so that we could also read Hebrews. We are so grateful for the freedom we have to do this and we know that God's Word brings light & life and will not return void.

* **Coach History**: Coached 17 years, this will be 8th trip to Nationals. Earned NMA over Hebrews & I & II Peter 8 years ago.
* **Quizzer History**:
  * Drew: 5th year quizzer; 2nd Nationals; NMA
  * Claire: 2nd year quizzer; 1st Nationals; NMA
  * Mike: 5th year quizzer; 1st Nationals; NMA
  * Nathan: 5th year quizzer; 1st Nationals; NMA
  * Austin: 3rd year quizzer; 2nd Nationals
* **Team History**\
As a team, this is a "1st trip" to Nationals. Both Drew and Austin attended last year. Each of these quizzers have at least one older brother and/or sister who has attended past Nationals. Maureen has coached all of her TBQ age children (and has only one left to be able to say she has coached all of them) at Nationals.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The most memorable match this season was beating our in-state rivals at Regional Finals. A couple of the quizzers planned a fruit snack (compliments of the host church - Dayspring, OH) celebration upon a victory. When they knew they had the game in hand, they began checking their pockets for the reward.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Probably the weirdest contest was one against our team at Regionals. Drew quoted several verses rather fast and rather slurry. When the QM and judges ruled him correct, we expected a contest on because of 3 or 4 goofy pronunciations, but were rather surprised when the coach of the opposing team said he counted at least 9 mistakes. He highlighted 4, we rebutted that certain words may have been pronounced strangely and pauses at strategic times could also cause difficulties, but we thought he had quoted everything correctly. We won the rebuttal.
* **Favorite question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Two of our favorite questions:\
From a question set of 8 years ago: Joey Bohanon prefaced this question with the disclaimer that the QM should pre-read the question so he wouldn't laugh and misread it. The question? Statement & Question. In the video game, Super Mario Brother, Mario's enemies are consumed by raging fireballs. According to Hebrews 10:27, whose enemies will be consumed by raging fire?\
A question written by one of our quizzers during a weekend practice: 2 Part Reference Essence Question. Give in essence the verse that mentions hurling and the verse that mentions vomiting.
* **Favorite verse from the material**
  * Drew: 1 Peter 2:12
  * Mike: 1 Peter 3:15
  * Austin: 2 Peter 3:8,9
  * Nathan: Hebrews 3:13
  * Claire: Hebrews 13:16
  * Maureen (Coach): Hebrews 13:2
* **Tournaments attended this year**
  * Michiana
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
Taking 3rd place in the trivia game at Buffalo Wild Wings at Regionals. Bowling with a partner at the same time, on the same lane, and getting a strike (both balls were needed). Playing spoons with lotion bottles instead of spoons (I will leave the results to your imagination). Talking with James Carrie.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
This season our team has held a lot of fundraisers (as usual) to raise money to attend tournaments, Regionals, and Nationals. This spring, however, we went door-to-door collecting pop cans to raise money to buy a Kirkman quiz set for the children of Managua, Nicaragua. A former quizzer from our church, Whitney Harr, is currently ministering with the ENGAGE group in Nicaragua, to children who live in the city dumps and nearby areas. She was asked to help start up JBQ by some other missionaries. They have one buzz box and lots of kids. Our goal is to raise enough to purchase one quiz set and extra supplies they need. We raised over $345.00 collecting cans and plan to raise the rest this summer so we can send the set back to Nicaragua with Whitney in September.

We quizzed for three years in California for Orange Hills assembly, before that our older kids quizzed for Irv Kuroishi. Thankfully we were coached in coaching by James Pryer, and Mary Pryer and mentored by Irv. We moved to Michigan in O8 and have quizzed for New Life Assembly since. We have been fortunate to qualify to go to nationals every year we've quizzed.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
John's rebuttal to a contest against James River after Karl said that a statement was cute but invalid. John agreed but said that no grown man should use the word cute in a contest.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * Michiana
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
With the economy we have had a couple of really hard years. We have had to evaluate what is important to our family and figure out how to make very limited resources cover us. There was a time this year that we were faced with deciding whether we could continue on past state finals. We kept going, and two days before we had to register our team for nationals, a completely unexpected check came in to cover the cost. It confirmed that God was with us in our decision to continue on.

* **Coach History**: Involved with quiz for 21 years, as a quizzer, official, coach and question writer. This is his second year to coach at national finals.
* **Quizzer History**:
  * Joshua: captain, MMA, NMA, Discipleship Award, senior, 7th year
  * Devon: MMA, NMA, Discipleship Award, 6th year
  * Jillian: NMA, Discipleship Award, 2nd year
* **Team History**\
This is 18th team James River has sent to nationals. They have competed at every National Finals since 2001, sending two teams in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. One of their teams has finished in the top five in the Championship Division for the the last seven years.
* **Interesting Historical Tidbits**\
Coach Karl Dawson is a former quizzer himself, having graduated over Hebrews and Peter in 1996. Although both records have since been broken, he holds the distinct honor of having both the most backward quizouts at nationals, with 11 in 1993 AND the most forward quizouts at nationals, with 18 in 1996.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Our most exciting match was actually an Individual Tournament game at the River Classic. Devon and Josh were both competing in the semifinal games against other very talented quizzers. Josh started strong, while Devon struggled. As the game went on, Devon had two wrong and needed four correct answers in a row to advance. He nailed the next four questions, winning a challenging contest on the last one. This left one question in the game which Josh had to get to advance. He makes the hit and gets it, but a contest renders the question invalid. Josh then gets the replacement question. The two James River quizzers emerged victorious.\
\
Our other exciting games were losses--a playoff against Garfield for the title at Friendship, and a de facto playoff game against Owasso at the River Classic that we lost in overtime.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We successfully argued in a response that the heart wasn't a body part.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Any question that requires them to quote Hebrews 9:5. This allows them to purposely mispronounce the word "cherubim" in a way that can't adequately be described with words.
* **Favorite verse from the material**\
The verse from which our team name is taken is pretty good. We also like most anything from 2 Peter 2.\
\
He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. (2 Peter 3:16)

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
We've had a pretty fun season. Here's a video that shows some of the highlights:
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
This has been the most amazing part of our season. There have been several times where Bible Quiz has intersected with life in some really neat ways:
  * In December, James River's quizzers partnered with our local Victory Mission to deliver Christmas baskets to underprivileged families in the community.
  * While working on the Discipleship Award, Jillian e-mailed a missionary family in Africa, asking if there was anything she could pray with them about. Two days later, she received a response. The missionaries were in the midst of a politically turbulent time, and as a result were having to quickly leave the country. God's timing was excellent, allowing Jillian to be used to pray for missionaries who needed it.
  * Devon recently shared this story:\
"Today in the morning I was praying for an opportunity to be able to talk about God with my golf team and be bold and all that other good stuff. So we had a practice round and we had to travel about an hour and so I brought my quiz and started doing quote cards on the ride there and the kid sitting beside me asked me about them and then started asking them to me. Pretty soon the whole team got involved and started asking them to me. That was cool enough by itself and then gradually throughout the rest of the day they kept asking me questions about God and sin and stuff. It was such an awesome opportunity. God is so good. Anyway, that's my awesome story of the day."

* **Team History**\
As a team this will be our 2nd year at Nationals. Even though we've only been quizzing on the same team for 2 years we've had a pretty long history together. Ellen and Bri got the be real good friends at their first Nationals in Green Bay, despite having to play off against each other in a 6 way tie for the last slot in the top division. (The two youngest teams to ever playoff at Nationals!)\
\
Since we were asked to give some interesting church history...we've heard all sorts of good stories about Joey Bohanon when he quizzed for Central, one including Joey dancing shirtless in the hotel fountain? Want to clear us up on that one Joey?\
\
(Added by Joey: I swear on Acts 5:1-11 that although I had a very interesting 6 years on the Central team, that never happened.)
* **Interesting Historical Tidbits**\
This team has finished second twice (1988 and 1997), third three times (1976, 1987 and 1996) and fourth once (2011). The church has also hosted national finals twelve times since 1964.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At Regionals this year we had a pretty strange thing happen. While we were quizzing out other Central team we had a major equipment malfunction. At question 5 Bri had obviously buzzed in first but the box didn't register it. After the question when we checked Bri's buzzer wasn't working so we had to start the match over from the beginning. When we got through question 7 on the do-over set it happened to Ellen's buzzer! By the end of the match we were checking buzzers in between every question and we had heard 34 questions (14 of them being subs since we didn't have any extra question sets.)
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Our favorite contest this year was on a quotation question. We made our rebuttal using all the quotation question contest phrases from the "Bible Quiz Greats." i.e. "A quotation question is unique in the fact that a quizzer can only say it once, and the judges can only hear it once," "It is the quizzer's responsibility to speak loudly and clearly enough," "How can you go back 3 minutes and rehear what the quizzer said?" etc.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
We don't have a favorite question this year but our least favorite is any variation on the question from Hebrews 2:6-8 that claims to be describing Jesus instead of man.
* **Favorite verse from the material**:
  * Ellen: 1 Peter 5:7
  * Bri: Hebrews 13:6
  * Amie: Hebrews 10:24

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
We have a lot of fun with people from our quiz program. Both of our favorite "non-quiz" related moments were on the way to or back from tournaments. The first one was when our team had to ride in a separate car because the bus was full. We kidnapped Matthew Klika and Daniel Quick from the bus and had them ride home in our car. We didn't stop laughing the whole way home. Our other favorite moment was on the way to Houston for the South Texas Tournament (again the most wonderful tournament ever!) We had the 15 passenger bus and only ten people. We brought along packages of bubbles and ended up having an all-out bubble war as we drove down the interstate and through Dallas traffic. There was soap everywhere by the time we were done. Take it from Bri and Ellen…bubbles are meant to be blown not eaten.\
\
(By the way Garfield in regard to your involuntary vandalism in Pittsburgh…we know a really good plumber…and we had extra soap.)

* **Team History**\
Gering, NE, made their Regional and National debuts last year. We were blessed to be undefeated at Regionals this year.\
\
Before any of the current team member's time, one Gering quizzer came up with the team name "Maximus Magnanimity" (intended to mean "the greatest kindness," what we should try to show to others.) When shortened to "M&Ms," it fit very well with the famed Nebraska tradition of giving out sweets after every match, so the name has stuck.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Definitely our match with Racine, Wisconsin at Regionals! After 19 questions fraught with contests, it came down to the wire, with the captains of both teams already out. Bethia hit the 20th and got it! We could have jumped through the ceiling for joy!
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
At the James River tournament, our team had been having an ongoing debate as to whether or not it was in good taste to refer to the outcomes of previous contests in a contest. The argument continued until our match with the Wagners, in which they quite nonchalantly invoked a previous ruling as corraborative evidence, firmly giving victory to the "it's perfectly fine" faction :-)
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Tyler Turnage's in the first match at Mid-Winter: "Secular scientists incorrectly hypothesize that the universe was formed by the 'Big Bang.' According to Hebrews, how was the universe formed?

She coached until her second child, Josiah was born in 1996. Michelle returned to Teen Bible Quiz when her son, Josiah, decided to get involved in TBQ.
  * Tonia Beliel: Helped with our quiz team for several years. This is her first year at Nationals as an assistant coach.
* **Quizzer History**:
  * Jennifer: Junior this year. This is her fifth year quizzing and her third time at Nationals. Two years ago she completed with Berean Assembly of God in the team competition.

  * Matthew: Seventh grader. This is his second year in quiz. This is his first year quizzing at Nationals.
  * Rachel Maki: Sophomore. She is part of our team that qualified for Nationals; unfortunately, she cannot travel with our team to Columbus.

First Assembly of God Cedar Rapids has qualified for Nationals ten times and attended nine times. This is our third year in a row to qualify for Nationals. Two years ago our team was not able to compete in Troy. In 2011 our team competed in the Championship bracket much to our surprise. This is our first year attending Nationals without our former head coach, Bill Chew. He "retired" from the Iowa quizzing and moved to Florida. In 1988, Bill received the honor of being the first, Coach of the Year.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At Regionals when we first looked at our schedule we knew that our first and last matches would be important ones. Our first match at Regionals we lost to Gering, NE on the last question. Our last match of the two days would decide who took second place at Regionals. It was against Racine, WI. During the first 6 or 7 questions the match was intense with the two teams battling back and forth. We ended up winning the game and took second place with one loss in the two days.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
It was a round against Southgate at the River Classic. The round was coming down to the last few questions and Jenn buzzed in on a 3 verse quote. They counted her correct, but Nilay contested. She thought she said everything perfectly, but the other team contested that she added an extra syllable when she paused in the middle of a word. Jenn thought that she was wrong because of who was contesting against her. But the contest was denied and the points remained the same.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Secular scientists incorrectly hypothesize that the universe was formed by the 'Big Bang.'\
According to Hebrews, how was the universe formed?
* **Favorite verse from the material**:
  * Jennifer: Jude 23 snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with fear- hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
  * Josiah: 1 Peter 1:7 These have come so that your faith-- of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire-- may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
  * Matthew: Hebrews 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
  * Rachel: Hebrews 4:13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
This year our quizzers helped with our Grocery Give-away at our church to give away groceries to people in our community. In May we also helped with packing 35,000 meals for Kids Against Hunger.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible quiz outside of church?**\
It is exciting when you can share about what Bible Quiz is all about when people ask what you are doing this weekend. It is a great way to share about Jesus.

* **Team History**\
This is NorthShore's third year as a quiz team. We have attended Regionals twice. This is the team's first year at nationals, though one of the quizzers and both of the coaches have attended nationals before.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Our team's most interesting match this year took place at Regionals. At the beginning of one round, our team was slightly behind the other team. Then, a member of the opposing team interrupted a question, the judges counted the answer incorrect, and our team answered correctly. Aaron, however, thought that the question should have been counted correct, so he initiated a contest (incurring a team foul), in which he asked the judges to reconsider their decision and count the opposing team's answer correct. They did. At this point, the judges awarded a five-point foul to our team, and the other coach jokingly asked if he could contest the foul. At this, the quizmaster (Ross Toeller) went out into the hall and consulted with the coordinator. When he returned, he told the quiz room that the judges would not be awarding a foul this time. (Upon hearing this, Aaron promptly tried to contest, but he was overruled.) Even though the contest put our team several points behind, our team eventually won the match.\
\
The team's State Finals playoff round against Gering, which was the last match of State Finals. Gering has been not only our most difficult competition this entire year, but they have become some of our best quizzing friends. OUr teams are very evenly matched, and every opportunity to tango with them leaves us sharper and more edified than when we started. They had been trouncing us all year in the league meets, and we were able to pull ahead of them by a whisker in the playoff match, finally ending their undefeated streak and becoming the state champions. (They, of course, promptly turned around and thrashed us at Regionals, and we look forward to the Nationals rematch.)
* **Favorite verse from the material**\
Hebrews 12:21 "The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, 'I am trembling with fear.'" Once during a confer at practice, the quizzers memorized this verse together by repeating it several times in unison. Whenever this verse comes up in a question, one of the quizzers will buzz in and say the verse with fervor, and everyone else enjoys the recitation.
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
On the way back from Regionals, two of our quizzers and Luke Hamilton from Gering were earnestly discussing Lord of the Rings. They even began to invent puzzling questions for "Lord of the Rings Quiz."

Highlights include: 2009 – 5th place; 2010 – 3rd place; 2011 – 2nd place. These placements account for the highest placement by any New Jersey team and the highest finish by any Northeast team since 1996.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Unanimously chosen was the 1st place playoff match against James River A/G at the Friendship Classic in January. While the match didn't come down to the wire, its implications were huge. Victory at this tournament had long eluded Garfield and, with their first Friendship victory, Garfield had now won every Northeast tournament at least once.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Also at the Friendship Classic was a contest that likened the question and answer requirements to the symbiotic relationship between a rhino and a tickbird. The contest not only confused the other team, but the officials as well.
* **Favorite question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
There can be only one – Seth's "outward cleansing and sanctification" Statement and Question at Regionals gets the vote for most ridiculously long statement and question of the year.
* **Favorite verse from the material**:
  * Justin – I Peter 4:18
  * Kyler - II Peter 2:15
  * Chris - Jude 12
  * Trey – Hebrews 6:9

A toss-up between – accidental vandalism at the Pittsburgh hotel we stayed at and an altercation with a cowboy trucker at Regionals. Ask the team if you want full disclosure.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
This season, more than ever, the discipleship aspect of TBQ has really showed our team not to take for granted the friendships we've made through this ministry. Sometimes, our team can get sick of each other. But the bonds forged over the time spent with teammates (as well as fellowship with other teams) will be some of the most important of your lives.

* **Team History**\
This is Journey A/G's fourth time at Nationals out of five seasons in the A League. Journey placed in the championship bracket each year, with last year being the best overall finish at 9th place. Journey is excited about this ministry of our Lord's. Although the competition is great fun, the fellowship around quiz has impacted Journey's quiz families the most.
* **Interesting Historical Tidbits**\
Assistant Coach, Grant Warnock started Journey quizzing as a National level team by finishing as top individual scorer at Nationals in Journey's first season of A League quizzing in 2008. He learned to quiz at the National level by watching Jeff Sharkey's 2007 National competition videos that were posted online.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Winning the final match at Regionals for Journey's best ever Regional finish.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Colton contesting the validity of a question that asked for an exclamation when the answer was a question. He said the question is highlighted pink in his Scripture portion (as additional proof that it was a question and not an exclamation). He further stated that he currently had an "A" in his English class (indicating the judges can trust him on this one).
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Not sure. But we do like Aaron Kohler's questions.
* **Favorite verse from the material**\
Hebrews 10:24 And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
Walking around New York City after Regionals with Colton attempting to talk with a New Yorker accent.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Being involved in Bible Quiz in general, and being able to recite Scripture verses in particular, has created opportunities to share with family, friends and classmates.

* **Team History**\
This is Living Hope's sixth year involved in Bible Quiz and our fourth year in a row attending national finals. We are proud to have been a part of the rapid growth that New Jersey Bible Quiz has experienced. During our first year on involvement, there were a total of roughly five teams (A and novice combined). This year New Jersey was blessed to have 17 teams (A, B, and MSQ combined) compete at districts.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Overcoming a deficit of 115 points on question 11 against Garfield, NJ to win in overtime and thus win our first District Championship.
* **Favorite Contest**\
When a quizzer of our team was answering, a guinea pig in the room suddenly began squealing extremely loudly and banging on the cage. The quizzer was called incorrect and we contested hindrance by the audience and it was accepted. A few weeks later, the guinea pig had to be put down due to its frequent seizures.
* **Favorite verse from the material**:

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
This season we have enjoyed many experiences from improving hacky-sack skills, having fun with drive through workers at Dunkin Donuts, shooting full-court basketball shots, and watching Tim Tebow in playoffs, to distributing black eyes to fellow team members (by accident). However, some of the best memories are made by simply hanging out and enjoying each other's company.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Bible Quiz has helped all of us with daily life and being ready "to give an answer to anyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have."\
\
Jared: I always put Bible Quiz on any of my resumes. Anyone (whether Christian or non-Christian) can respect the fact that a youth has memorized multiple books of the Bible. It's amazing how many conversations this can open up.

* **Coaches History**\
Don York has coached Teen Bible Quiz in the Potomac District for fourteen years. He has led teams to Regional Finals eleven times and to National Finals five times over that time period. He himself has received the National Memorization Award twice, once for Hebrews and I & II Peter and once for the Gospel of Matthew. Coach York has served in the role of statistician for Potomac District quizzing for more than ten years. His greatest blessing as a coach is to see his former quizzers, now scattered all over the country, living for Jesus. The Word of God is the reason Coach York started quizzing and is the reason he continues to coach and remain involved with quizzing. One of the Psalms he memorized as a young Christian over thirty years ago sums it up best, "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers." Thank you, Lord, for your living and enduring Word!
* **Quizzer History**:
  * Joshua: 16 years old. I received Jesus Christ as my savior when I was six years old. I began quizzing four years ago with the Gospel of Mark. I quizzed in Novice for one year and then moved to A-League. Over the course of my quizzing career, I have quizzed over the Gospel of Mark, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, the Gospel of John and now Hebrews/1st and 2nd Peter. I have received the N.M.A award for John and Hebrews/1st and 2nd Peter and with M.M.A for Hebrews. My most exciting match was when we quizzed for an hour and a half at Regionals in just one match! My favorite verse for this year is Jude 1:1 because it has many truths. This year, I have attended two tournaments - Friendship and Three Rivers both in Pennsylvania. My favorite non-quiz moment was when I listened to my team rap freestyle on the way back from the Three Rivers Tournament.
  * David: 14 years old. I received Jesus Christ as my savior when I was six years old. I began quizzing in Junior Bible Quiz in 2009. I participated in Junior Bible Quiz for two years. My team went to Nationals in both of those years. In my last year of Junior Bible Quiz, my team finished in 3rd place overall at Nationals. During my participation in Junior Bible Quiz, I received the Master Seal Award and the Impossible award. I began quizzing in Novice two years ago with the book of John and last year decided to join the A-league. Over the course of my quizzing career, I have quizzed over the Gospel of John and the books of Hebrews/1st and 2nd Peter. I have received the N.M.A. for the books of John and Hebrews/ 1st and 2nd Peter. My most interesting match was against Central, Indiana. There were seven different contests! Somehow, we still finished within the time limit for that match. My favorite verse is Hebrews 13:25. The verse is way too long. My favorite non-quiz moment was when we all had a rap battle on the way back from regionals. There were three different rounds and after each round we judged each rap on a scale of 1 to 10. The rapper with the most points at the end won.
  * Sam York: Quizzing for 10 years. He started Junior Bible Quiz in 3rd grade and has quizzed 6 years in Teen Bible Quiz. He has memorized 12 books of the Bible and has been on 3 National Finals teams. Through quizzing Sam has made awesome friends and has grown in the Lord. Sam graduates the Science and Technology Program at Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Greenbelt, MD) this year and is excited to be attending Grove City College in Pennsylvania where he will major in Music Education.
  * Zerubabbel: I began quiz at Word of Life in 2007 with the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. In addition to that I have also quizzed over Mark, 1 & 2 Corinthians, John, and Hebrews, 1 & 2 Peter, and Jude. I have competed at Nationals once in 2011 and this year will be my second time.
  * Abhishek: Quizzed for 7 years. He accepted Christ as his personal Savior at the age of nine and baptized in water and in the Holy Spirit at Kids Camp. He began in Junior Bible Quiz in 6th grade where he achieved the Master Seal. He joined the the very first TBQ team at Word of Life in 2006-2007 as a Novice member. In his second year, he and his teammates won Regionals 2008 Novice Championship. Abhishek began his Bible memorization in GEP(CP) and over the course of 7 years he has been privileged to memorize Mark, Corinthians, John, Hebrews/Peter. He has earned the NMA three times and MMA in Hebrews. From TBQ Camp, tournaments, and league matches, he has made many friendships and has grown in Christ. Although he does not have a favorite verse, he enjoys studying and memorizing the books of Paul. His favorite times are the times we are returning from matches, no pressure, just enjoying the silly games, especially the aforementioned rap battles.
  * Sadya Ouedraogo: 14 years old. I was first introduced to bible quiz through a family friend in 5th grade and I have been in it ever since. I was in JBQ for 2 years and in MSQ for two years. I am currently in TBQ and I have had the privilege to memorize the book of 1st Corinthians, John, Hebrews and 1st and 2nd Peter. I completed my NMA for the book of John. My favorite contest this season was with Mrs. Haines on whether or not day after day is the same as daily. It was very amusing because this is also a common topic at our practices. In my opinion our best non- quiz related moments were in the car, whether it was sharing jokes, discussing books, or talking about sports. I am a leader for our Fellowship of Christian Athlete club at my school. Every Friday morning my friend and I teach a lesson to our peers on Jesus Christ and how he can help us in our lives. By being in bible quiz I am able to quickly pull out verses related to the topics we discuss and make connections to our everyday life. It reminds me that TBQ isn't just about memorizing verses but also understanding what we are reciting.
* **Team History**\
Word of Life started its first team in 2007 with youth graduating from the JBQ program and two high schoolers. We had no idea that TBQ would be so different. Our very first year, God brought a former quizzer, Beth Reynolds, and Don York to help us get started. In our very first Gobblefest 2007 tournament, I remember being in an A-league match where another team contested one of our initially correct answers and points were taken away from us. That was a very low point for us. We lost every match that tournament. But rather dwelling on our disappointments, we asked God for His help in learning this new way of quizzing. Some of our greatest disappointments have caused our team to rebound positively. We have been privileged to be at Nationals in 2010, 2011, and now in 2012. Most of all we have had a great time in fellowship, travel, and studying God's Word. Our prayer and goal is that each person applies the Word of God to their lives and is filled with the Holy Spirit, who leads us into all truth.
* **Interesting Historical Tidbits**\
Coach Don York also coached for Cornerstone A/G in Bowie, Maryland at nationals in 2003 and 2004. Also, this church was the location for national finals in 1998.

During her four years as a quizzer at nationals, she placed 5th individually in Championship, first individually and as a team in Challenger, and first in the preaching ministry two years in a row. She also received the Female Quizzer of the Year and Curtis Scholarship awards and correctly answered the infamous "60-point question" in the 2008 boys vs. girls exhibition match to win the match for the girls. She received National Memorization for 13 books of the Bible and completed the Master Memorization four times. Last year she was head coach of the Binghamton Middle School team. The past two years she has assistant coached the TBQ team at Nationals, and this year she became head coach of the TBQ team.
  * Henry (Hank) and Annette: In 2006, when LaJoie's TBQ coach stepped down, Annette and Hank were led by the Lord to assume leadership of the TBQ ministry at First Assembly. Hank became head coach of the TBQ team that year, while Annette coached one of the church's Novice teams. Under their leadership, the Binghamton Bible Quiz ministry has discipled and coached dozens of students in the Word, focusing not only on memorization and competition, but also on Bible study, ministry, and outreach. This year, they are both assisting LaJoie in coaching the TBQ team.
* **Quizzer History**:
  * Isaac: Quizzing with First Assembly for seven years. This is his fifth and final year at National Finals. This year, he received the National and Master Memorization and Discipleship Awards. He has memorized 14 books completely and two partially (during Novice), receiving the National Memorization award twice in novice and five times in TBQ, and receiving the Master Memorization five times.
  * Aaron: Quizzing with First Assembly for four years. He is a sophomore, and this will be his second time at National Finals and his second year in TBQ. Aaron placed first individually at Northeast Regional Finals during his final year in Middle School Quiz.
* **Team History**\
Binghamton First Assembly of God has competed at National Finals for the past seven years. Last year, Aaron and Isaac broke records for the highest placing of a two-man team under the current rules. The team reached sixth place, the church's highest placing in recent history.
* **Interesting Historical Tidbit**\
This team also attended nationals in 1968 and 1993.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We won the match against Wesley Chapel during the preliminary rounds at Friendship Classic. It was a very clean match and well-played by both teams.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
In a sectional meet we had a team contest that they shouldn't receive a foul because the pre-response hit was during the pause between the introductory remarks and the question. Everyone was confused during the match, and we tried to straighten it out, but it wasn't until after the match that the correct rule was found. It was pretty confusing!
* **Favorite question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
One of Joey's practice questions:\
Statement and 3-Part Reference Question.\
Modern worship songs are usually very loud, repeated endlessly, and require you to stand forever.\
What is loud, what is repeated endlessly, and what stands forever?\
* **Favorite verse from the material**\
2 Peter 3:16 "He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction."\
\
Aaron and Isaac both agree that Paul's letters (and often, the question writer's questions!) contain things that are hard to understand. Still, it's important to persevere, memorize those tough verses, and stay strong to the end.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * [Gobblefest]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/gobblefest.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
Laser tag and games after Friendship Classic with our friends from other churches!\
\
We have lots of laughs in our practices, especially when LaJoie is reading questions. One of the funniest things that happened recently was when Isaac was trying to quote Jude 12, and he said, "…trees without roots and upfruited," completely by accident!\
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Isaac and Aaron had the incredible opportunity of competing in an exhibition match with other quizzers from their district in front of thousands of teens at the NYS AG Youth Convention. This was an awesome way to show the youth of New York how Bible Quiz actually works.\
\
All of the Binghamton Bible Quizzers, including those who only competed up to the District level, participated in volunteering with Operation Christmas Child collection. The team also packed about a dozen boxes themselves and donated them to the outreach. This is a much-enjoyed yearly activity for our Bible Quizzers, and is one way we get to put the Word into action!

* **Quizzer History**:
  * Joe: MMA, NMA
  * Elijah: NMA
* **Team History**\
This is Pocono Community Church's first appearance at Nationals.
* **Interesting Historical Tidbit**\
The last time Aaron coached at Nationals was 8 years ago, over Hebrews and Peter. The star quizzer of the team he coached was Katie. The team finished 3rd that year and Katie finished 3rd high scorer.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Unfortunately any exciting match we can recall we lost! We are hoping this may change with some beginners luck at Nationals.
* **Favorite question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
The team most enjoys hearing their coach's quiz questions since he has no trouble creating numerous ones. Our favorite is: Girls like flowers. Quote the verse in which flowers are mentioned."

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
It would have to be the day both the boys showed up late for practice. Unfortunately this gave Aaron and Amanda too much time to talk. They decided the guys would run a lap around the house for each minute they were late. Let's just say they did a lot of running.\
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
We can pinpoint several times throughout the season where we have had opportunities where quizzing led us to Christ centered discussions or where the scripture we have memorized helped us in discussions with coworkers, parents and family. It's as if the scripture we have learned serves as a stepping stone to being outwardly focused. We have also noticed how it can encourage those around us to dig deeper into God's word too.

* **Coaches History**
  * Heather: Second year coaching for Cedar Park. Last year, she was head coach for the Middle School team and joined the top team at Nationals as an assistant coach. A former quizzer, Heather quizzed for six years and made five trips to National Finals (thus, cumulatively, this is her seventh year at Nationals).
  * Bonnie: Coaching, officiating, and coordinating for Cedar Park wherever needed off and on for the past eight years. She has officiated twice at Nationals, and this will be her second year coaching at Nationals (her first stint was as assistant coach for Cedar Park's "Eternal Mystery" team in 2006).
* **Quizzer History**:
  * André: Quizzing for 5 years, and this is his second year at National Finals. He is in 9th grade and received the NMA.
  * Anita: Quizzing for 5 years, and this is her third year at National Finals. She is in 10th grade.
  * EJ: Quizzing for 2 years, and this is his first year at National Finals. He is in 8th grade and received the NMA.
  * Jacob: Quizzing for 2 years, and this is his first year at National Finals. He is in 8th grade and received the NMA.
  * Jonathan: Quizzing for 2 years, and this is his first year at National Finals. He is in 8th grade.
  * Samuel: Quizzing for 2 years, and this is his first year at National Finals. He is in 10th grade and received the NMA.
* **Team History**\
Cedar Park Assembly from Bothell, WA has made significant contributions to National Finals over the years. This year, we will break the record for the most teams a church has sent consecutively to Nationals with 15 appearances (every Nationals since 1998) and 19 teams. Cedar Park also holds the record for the most consecutive 2nd place finishes with four from 2006-2009. As a fun fact, Cedar Park has a knack for getting themselves into playoff situations at Nationals. When the National championship had been decided without a playoff for 10 years, Cedar Park came in and won the tie for first in 2005; the following year, we won the playoff for second (as well as the second team making it out of an at the time unheard of 5-way playoff in the preliminary round); still the following year, we lost a playoff for first place in 2007. Cedar Park would be playoff-free for the next two years (although being in contention for the championship certainly made every match feel like a playoff!), until they would return to the playoff circuit with the premier of the Final Four format in 2010.
* **Most Exciting Match This Season**\
The team unanimously chose our match against Mountain View Assembly (affectionately known as "Ani & Adi" or "Cedar Park East") at Regionals. The match came down to the 20th question; fortunately for us, however, Ani had quizzed out backwards on question 16, and Adi had quizzed out forward on question 19. EJ grabbed the last 10 and solidified our 5-point victory.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
During one of the matches at Snake River, the opposing team answered a question requiring Hebrews 10:23 for the answer. The quizzer answered perfectly, except he changed the phrase "the hope we profess" to "the faith we profess." The officials ruled him wrong, and he contested, trying to convince the officials that hope and faith were the same thing. The opposing team presented their contest, and EJ presented the rebuttal, using Hebrews 11:1 as evidence that faith and hope were not the same. The opposing team's contest was denied, and we won that particular match.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
The one question that sends giggles through the whole team every time it comes up in practice: "Question for 10 points. Give a complete answer. From the section titled "By Faith." How good was Abraham? (H 11:12 as good as dead)" Also, there is a certain quizzer on our team that always manages to hit on any questions coming from 1 Peter 4:3. Needless to say, said quizzer has taken some ribbing on account of it.
* **Favorite verse**:
  * André: H 12:12
  * Anita: H 11:34
  * EJ: H 4:16
  * Jacob: 2P 3:16
  * Jonathan: 1P 4:1
  * Samuel: Jude 15
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
  * Snake River Classic
* **Best non quiz-related moment**\
It's so hard to pick just one! The team made lots of memories watching the Chronicles of Narnia in Spanish in the lobby of the hotel at Snake River. Also, our study retreat produced a host of memories involving corn flakes, rap nicknames, and mathematical covers of popular songs. And I simply could not submit this item without at least mentioning a certain evening consisting of socks, ceiling fans, wooden walls, and coaches crying on the floor from laughter.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Four of our team members belong to our church's karate ministry. They are required to memorize verses in order to achieve different belts, and they also have a devotional every week. Memorizing these books has given them the opportunity to contribute more to the discussion. Also, Anita encourages her friends at school to study the Bible.

* **Quizzer History**:
  * Adi Purohith, Ani Purohith (yes, they are twins): Third consecutive year at Nationals, the previous two with Cedar Park but a family move across the state to Spokane necessitated a division this year. They both earned the MMA this year.
* **Team History**\
Mountain View has never had a team go to Nationals before, and in fact hasn't had a team at the church in many years. But the quizzers and coach have been together, as noted above, for two previous Nationals with Cedar Park.\
\
The most interesting thing about this team is that the coaches live 5 hours' drive away from the quizzers! Quizzing over Skype is only marginally successful and really too frustrating: talk about a "bleeding" quizmaster, when there's a lag between the buzzer and the time you hear it! =) So we mostly just get together at quiz meets and via phone with a few trips to half-way points, etc. The boys have to be really disciplined to keep up on their own, and they've done such an excellent job!
* **Interesting Historical Tidbits**\
Kari was at Nationals as a quizzer in 1978 and 1981 and began coaching right after her final year, but didn't coach for a long time while pursuing graduate degrees. She and her sister, Kristi, started coaching again in 2002-2003. They've had teams at Nationals since 2004, most of those years with Cedar Park (Bothell, WA), making this Kari's ninth consecutive year and thirteenth total.
* **Most Exciting Match This Season**\
Probably trying to beat Abby (who quizzed alone) at River Classic! We finally had another team outnumbered and nearly blew it: I think we had to get the last question to win! =)
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We won three contests in one match at Regionals against an opposing coach who was engaged to the quizmaster. I think they're still actually going to get married! =)
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Weirdest? Definitely the "count the unique words in this verse" questions!
* **Favorite verse**\
  * Adi: Hebrews 7:25
  * Ani: Hebrews 4:12
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
  * Snake River Classic
* **Best non quiz-related moment**\
Any time the Gonzaga Bulldogs or the Miami Heat win. We have to plan our practices around their games! Conversely, the worst moment was when the Zags lost out of the NCAA tournament while we were quizzing at League IV and couldn't even be watching.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
It sure helps all of us with Bible classes at school!

\
It is always interesting when we get asked, "Where is the FOURTH brother"? The interesting thing is that they really do have a fourth brother. Joshua is now serving this great nation with the United States Army in Afghanistan. The Fourth Brother in this case is Jesus - see Hebrews 2:11
* **Most Exciting Match This Season**\
The most exciting match this year was at the Northwest Regional's against Bellevue. Both teams were their respective State Champions. Tension was building the entire match, with multiple lead changes throughout. It came down to the last question. The only way we could win was for them to interrupt and get it wrong, and for us to get the re-read correct. Bellevue did interrupt and was judged incorrect. And Andrew buzzed in and quoted the first two verses correctly. Unfortunately there was a third verse, and our wonderful quizzer number 2 (the second brother) said a phrase from a different verse, and was ruled incorrect, resulting in us having the opportunity to experience "The Agony of Defeat". It was a long walk home for Andrew:)
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
When a quizzer from the opposing team buzzed in on the question --"When was Enoch commended as one who pleased God"......the quizzer answered..."Before he died"---the Quiz master ruled the answer correct. We contested and said "Enoch did not die" - rebuttal stated that "This is only true of two people in history, and therefore we agree with their contest".
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Somehow the author of Hebrews manages to answer two questions with two questions..give them?
* **Favorite verse**:
  * J.B.: Hebrews 2:11 - "Both the one who makes men Holy and those who are made Holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them Brothers."
  * Andrew: Hebrews 10:38-39 - But my righteous one will live by faith and if he shrinks back I will not be pleased with him. But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.
  * Michael: Hebrews 4:15-16 - For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * Snake River Classic
* **Best non quiz-related moment**\
Playing Dutch Blitz with fellow quizzers in the hotel lobby after the Snake River Classic.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
When we meet new friends, they often ask what our hobbies are. This gives us the opportunity to tell them about Bible Quiz, and how much studying God's Word means to us. It has proved to be an excellent witnessing tool.

* **Coach and Quizzer History**\
The Highpointe team this year consists of Micah Samuelson, Connor McGraw and Matthew Samuelson. Head coach is Elizabeth Bluebird and assisting me is Michael Samuelson. This is Elizabeth's 19th year of coaching Bible quiz at the same church. Michael has been coaching at Highpointe for 5 years, but this is his first year as a coach at Nationals, because he officiated at the past two years. Neither of us quizzed as a teen. In college, I saw a demonstration of quiz and decided this is a ministry I would like to be a part of. So as soon as I graduated and became a member of Highpointe (formerly Lakeside), I approached the pastor about starting a BQ ministry in the church. It has a been a wonderful learning experience. This year Matthew has earned the National Memorization award. Connor McGraw and Micah Samuelson as well as coach Elizabeth Bluebird has earned the Master Memorization award.
* **Team History**\
This is the team's third year at Nationals. Micah has been all three years, but this is Matthews and Connors second time. In 2010 in Detroit we placed 4th in the Contender division. Last year in Dallas we placed 12th in the Championship division.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Our most exciting match this year was our last one at Regionals. We had tied for second and was having a play-off. It was very close and we lost by only 10 points. It is hard to lose sometimes.
* **Favorite verse from the material**\
The teams favorite verse is I Peter 3:7. With three boys on the team, I was a little surprised they pick that verse, and I pray that they will live by that verse when they do get married.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Gold Cup]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/gold-cup.md %})
  * [Missouri Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/missouri-classic.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2012/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment(s) this year**\
Our favorite non-quiz memory is the Highpointe quizzers sponsoring a back to school backpack giveaway at a small Hispanic church that averages about 50 people each Sunday. Last year we gave away 850 backpacks filled with supplies and over 1000 people heard the gospel message. It was a lot of work, but it is also a blessing to minister to so many people. This year we hope to give away over 1000 backpacks.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Since we are doing Hebrews this year, I would like to talk about when I first did Hebrews 16 years ago. That year I decided as a coach to memorize Hebrews with my quizzers. It was my first year to try and memorize an entire book. During that year I was asked to go a mission trip with a Seventh Day Adventist Church. (My boss's husband was the trip leader, and they were wanting someone who was experienced in Medical Mission trips to go and help coordinate the medical part). On the bus the first day a young man sat down beside me and started telling me why they believed the way they did and why I was wrong. Each time he used Scripture from the OT to prove their point, I was able to use scripture from Hebrews to explain the new covenant. He soon gave up and went back to his own seat. This proved to me how invaluable learning the Word is.

When Reesie searched a trash can for the post-Regionals scavenger hunt.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Generally the application of scripture according to Abby: "With so many verses running through my head all the time, it's like having access to the Word even when I don't have a Bible on hand. And being this familiar with scripture allows me to quickly recall a given passage and bring it up when needed. That's the whole point of bq, right? I never want to take this knowledge of the Word for granted. Taking it beyond the quiz table is the best."

* **Team History**\
Snellville has been involved with Bible Quiz from the beginning, winning the very first Bible Quiz nationals in 1963. Snellville (also called Bouldercrest, Decatur and Centerville) has appeared at Nationals 22 times and winning 2 more times in 1976 and 1978. For many years until 2010, Snellville was coached by Mark Gilmer, an amazing coach who affected numerous lives significantly including my own. Mark was also a member of the quiz teams during the 1970's wins at nationals.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At the Georgia District Competition there was a tie for first place between Snellville and Cumming. Both teams had studied diligently and competed well over the day. The match was in a room that was too small and too hot for the number of people who were there, but it was interesting as it would have been Snellville's first number one spot at districts in several years. The match started off pretty even, with several near misses and amazing grabs by both teams. As the match drew closer to the end, the final 30 point question, a quote, was asked. It was hit by one of the quizzers, a substitute for Ceiran who had quizzed out. Unfortunately, a single mistake cost the question and resulted in a 45 point swing ultimately losing the match. Though a loss, it taught a lot about quizzing and was a match that won't be forgotten easily.

## Special Events

### Match of Death

<a href="{% link assets/2012/match-of-death-questions.pdf %}" class="button is-primary">Questions</a>

{% include youtube.html
   video="MGLsge-0m8c" %}

The Match of Death began in 2010. That year, the East-West quiz had been eliminated and an "underground" one was organized as a best two out of three. Two sets were taken from writer Richard Ely, and one set, full of extra hard questions was written by Richard Fair and Joey Bohanon. James Lex answered the last question of his career by giving 1 Corinthians 13 in 30 seconds. The following year, more questions were added, some new introductory remarks were coined and some questions were given more than 30 seconds to answer. The most memorable answer was Abby Rogers giving all 262 references for Jesus in about 4 minutes. This year, Greg House and Joey Bohanon wrote 40 questions that were challenging and funny. One of them required a quizzer to solve a quadratic equation to answer, and another was read "Jeopardy" style, where the answer was read and quizzers could interrupt, finish the answer, then give the question. In addition, to celebrate 50 years of Bible Quiz, history questions were asked. The set may be seen here.
