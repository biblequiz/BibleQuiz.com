The 50th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 1 - 5, 2012 in Columbus, Ohio at the Hyatt Regency Hotel covering Hebrews, 1 & 2 Peter and Jude. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Seth Sundell was the official question writer.

The national championship was won by Owasso First A/G, Owasso, OK (pictured). This was Owasso's fourth national championship, the other three being in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Owasso also won the round robin in 2010 however came in second following the Final Four playoffs. This was the fifth win for the state of Oklahoma (the other being in 1982) and the seventh win for the South Central region. Owasso is now the second team to win four national championships, the other being The Church at Briarage from Colorado Springs, CO (2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007).

This was the third year the Final Four format was used to determine the national champion. Coming in second place in the Final Four playoff was Wesley Chapel, FL. Third place went to Garfield, NJ and fourth place went to James River A/G, Ozark, MO. All four of these teams have histories of doing well at national finals. Wesley Chapel, who won the round robin with an 18-1 record (only the fourth team to do so) won national finals in 2010 and finished third in 2011. Garfield finished second in the round robin in 2010 and won the round robin in 2011, placing second in the Final Four. James River has had teams finish in the top 5 every year since 2005.

The challenger division was won by Newport Mesa A/G, Costa Mesa, CA.

The top scorer at the 2012 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the fourth consecutive and seventh overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). Abby was also top quizzer in 2010 and 2011. This makes her only the second person to be high scorer three times, much less three consecutive years (the other being Kent Piacenti from 1997 to 1999). Abby's per quiz average was 126.32. Second high scorer was Daniel Wagner from Owasso, OK. Joseph Chacra from Mt. Pocono, PA placed third. Rounding out the top five were Kyler Sederwall from Garfield, NJ and Joshua George from Ozark, MO.

The individual tournament was won by Abby Rogers, her second win. Daniel, Kyler and Abby battled for the title of quoting bee champion during the banquet and finished in that order.

The east-west took place on Wednesday afternoon and the East won. In addition, an unofficial quiz, dubbed the "Match of Death", with very hard, unusual and funny questions took place after the banquet eight top quizzers. We will be uploading the set soon, but the entire match is available in the "Memories" section.

The invitational national one-on-one was won by Courtney Walin. Results from this competition may be seen here.

Much was made of this being the 50th national finals. Special speakers included Bible Quiz founder Owen Carr and former top scorer John Wootton. In addition, George Edgerly and Bernie Elliot were given plaques to honor their many years of service to the Bible Quiz ministry.

### Match of Death

<a href="{% link assets/2012/match-of-death-questions.pdf %}" class="button is-primary">Questions</a>

{% include youtube.html
   video="MGLsge-0m8c" %}

The Match of Death began in 2010. That year, the East-West quiz had been eliminated and an "underground" one was organized as a best two out of three. Two sets were taken from writer Richard Ely, and one set, full of extra hard questions was written by Richard Fair and Joey Bohanon. James Lex answered the last question of his career by giving 1 Corinthians 13 in 30 seconds. The following year, more questions were added, some new introductory remarks were coined and some questions were given more than 30 seconds to answer. The most memorable answer was Abby Rogers giving all 262 references for Jesus in about 4 minutes. This year, Greg House and Joey Bohanon wrote 40 questions that were challenging and funny. One of them required a quizzer to solve a quadratic equation to answer, and another was read "Jeopardy" style, where the answer was read and quizzers could interrupt, finish the answer, then give the question. In addition, to celebrate 50 years of Bible Quiz, history questions were asked. The set may be seen here.
