The 3rd National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 27-28, 1965 in Des Moines, Iowa covering the book of Mark. Russell J. Cox was the National Coordinator and Kermit Jeffrey was the official question writer.

The event was won by Calvary Full Gospel A/G, Inglewood, CA. The second place team was Fremont A/G, Fremont, NE.

The team from Calvary Full Gospel A/G, Inglewood, CA became the first team from a region other than the Southeast to win Nationals as teams from Georgia and North Carolina had won in 1963 and 1964. Teams from California would also win Nationals in 1969, 1989, 1993, 1999, 2002 and 2003 making it one of the two states with the most victories at National Finals with seven titles (Colorado won nationals in 1966, 1967, 1977, 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007). Participants in the 1965 event included the first ever champions from 1963, Bouldercrest A/G, Atlanta, GA, and the second place team from 1964, East Gary A/G, East Gary, IN.

The third National Bible Quiz Finals was a single elimination tournament with the first place teams from the eight regions participating. The single elimination format was used for the first three years of the event. In addition, the championship match was again played in the evening in front of the General Council attendees.

### Individuals

The third National Bible Quiz Tournament in 1965 did not announce the top quizzers. The tournament was single elimination meaning that the maximum number of quizzes a team could play was 3. Therefore, it is difficult to determine who was the top quizzer. In the final quiz for first place, Steve Sorensen of Calvary Full Gospel A/G, Inglewood, CA, who had been the top scorer on his team in the previous two rounds, was the top quizzer with 120 points as his team won the tournament.
