The 23rd National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 5-7, 1985 in San Antonio Texas covering the gospel of Luke. Barry Kolanowski was the National Coordinator and David Baird was the official question writer.

The format this year was the same as the 1984 National Finals. The sixteen teams were split into two brackets and played an 8-team round robin. At the end, the top two teams moved on to a "Final Four" playoff where four teams played a full round-robin.

The event was won by Ypsilanti A/G, Ypsilanti, MI (pictured). They defeated the second place team, First A/G, Tempe, AZ in a playoff. The other two "Final Four" teams were First A/G, Hibbing, MN and Renton A/G, Renton, WA.

This was only the second year in which the Great Lakes region had won nationals, the previous time being in 1972 when Palos Heights, IL won.

This year also could be called the year of playoffs. In Group A, there was a five-way tie for first that required two playoffs. Then there were three "Final Four" playoffs. Then there was a playoff for first place. Even with the modern day addition of forty teams, this stands as the year with the most playoffs, with six.

The top scorer at the 1985 National Finals was Lester Cowen of Festus, MO. Nicole Brandon of Tulsa, OK, who would be top scorer in 1986, was second and Sean Davis of Renton, WA was third. Sean would go on to write questions for nationals eight years later over Luke.
