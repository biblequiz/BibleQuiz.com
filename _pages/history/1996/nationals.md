The 34th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 9-13, 1996 in Springfield, Missouri at Central Assembly of God covering the books of Hebrews and I,II Peter. Rich Percifield was the National Coordinator and Bryan Turner was the official question writer.

This was the first year in which 24 teams were invited to participate and where all teams play in a full round-robin, although the Northwest region did not send a third-place team this year. From 1993 to 1995, only four third-place teams were allowed to participate.

The national championship was won by Grace A/G, Syracuse, NY, a team that had finished fifth in 1994 and second in 1995, finally won 1st place and established themselves as one of the most dominant team of the 1990's. They would continue their winning ways by placing third in both 1998 and 1999. The second place team was Evangel Heights A/G, Sarver, PA.

This was the second consecutive victory for the Northeast region after Allison Park A/G, Allison Park, PA's victory in 1995. Outside of these two victories, the only other championship for the Northeast region was Ebony Assembly of God, Ebony, VA in 1973. This was also the second consecutive Northeast sweep of the top two spots which further illustrates the region's dominance in this year. 1996 marked the third consecutive year that one region occupied first and second place, and the sixth time that this had occured since more than one team from each region began attending Nationals in 1984.

Central A/G (1), Springfield, MO, another perennial National finalist, won third place by defeating Calvary Church, Naperville, IL in a playoff. Allison Park A/G, Allison Park, PA the previous year's champion, finished seventh - easily making the Northeast region the toughest this year.
