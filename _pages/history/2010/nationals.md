The 48th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 5-9, 2010 in Troy, Michigan at the Marriott Hotel covering epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Richard Ely was the official question writer. This was the fourth year in which Richard wrote questions, having previously written from 2005 to 2007.

The national championship was won by Victorious Life Church, Wesley Chapel, FL (pictured). This was the first win for an eastern region since 1997 and the first win for the Southeast region since 1991, when Wesley Chapel's coach, Joshua Weber, was on a team from Lakeland, FL that won back-to-back nationals.

This year a new format was used to determine the national champion. The top four teams at the end of the regular round-robin were seeded 1 through 4 in a Final Four playoff match. Those teams were: 1. Owasso, OK, 2. Garfield, NJ, 3. Wesley Chapel, FL, 4. Bothell, WA. On Thursday morning, Owasso beat Bothell and Wesley Chapel beat Garfield in the semi-final matches. Garfield then beat Bothell for third place and Wesley Chapel beat Owasso for the championship. The matches were streamed over the internet and can be seen by clicking the "memories" link above.

The challenger division was won by First A/G of Greater Lansing, East Lansing, MI, who tied with First A/G, Montgomery, AL in the round-robin but beat them in head-to-head competition.

This marks the seventh overall year in which the Southeast region has won nationals. In addition to Wesley Chapel coach, Joshua Weber, former national champion Mark Gilmer, from Decatur, GA (now Snellville) was in attendance as well.

The top scorer at the 2010 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the second consecutive and fifth overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). This was also the first time a female has been top quizzer since 1995. Abby's per quiz average was 118.16. Second high scorer was James Lex from Cumming, GA. James was last year's second high scorer as well. Jacob Wyatt from Champaign, IL was third high scorer. Rounding out the top five were brothers Daniel Wagner (4th) and Jesse Wagner (5th) who finished only five points apart.

The individual tournament was won by Abby Rogers as well. This was the tenth time the individual tournament was won by a member of the national championship team. To finish up her complete domination of the individual quizzing this year, Abby also won the quoting bee. To top it all off, on Friday Abby coached the team that won the adult quiz competition.

While there was no official east-west at the banquet, hundreds of people crowded into a very small room after the banquet to watch a best 2 out of 3 East vs. West series. The first two rounds were split by east and west, using unused playoff sets by Richard Ely. The final game was won by the West on a set written by Central A/G coach Richard Fair consisting of 10 20's and 10 30's. The 20's were normal 20's, but the 30's were extremely hard, culminating in graduating senior James Lex quoting all of 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 in just under 30 seconds. The first match started around 10 PM and the last one finished just before 1 AM! We are in the process of getting videos from these matches.

* **Most exciting match this season**\
Probably the match against Overland Park KS at the James River Tournament. A great match, back and forth the whole way, which was eventually called due to the time limit.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Successfully arguing the difference between 'free man' and 'freedman'. Also winning, or successfully rebutting, contests based on grammar rules including: punctuation, double negatives, capitalization, and verb vs. adjective.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
20 points S&Q GCA from 2CV. Many questions say that Paul's writings and teachings were true. What was actually true? 1C5:1-2
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1C4:9-13 & 20
* **Tournaments attended this year**:

  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
All the discussion that we've had due to the way questions are worded and through our memorization of the scripture. You would be surprised and shocked at the deep theological issues we create and deal with. Also, the craziness of driving into Philadelphia to run the Rocky steps and eat Philly cheesesteaks....Oh the memories....
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
We go as a team to the Bowling Green Courthouse to read/recite God's Word on the courthouse steps during the week leading up to the National Day of Prayer. We have also been able to apply the scripture in daily life and conversation to great effect.

* **Team History**\
Our team moved from California to Michigan. This will be our fifth trip to Nationals. Three years in California as Orange Hills and now our second trip as New Life Assembly in White Cloud Michigan. We are pretty excited that Michigan is hosting Nationals this year! Our team originally was part of Santa Ana's team but we left that church. Thankfully Irv Kuroishi had done a good job teaching our quizzers James and Mary- they in turn taught us the game. Irv helped us with study material our first year to Nationals. He worked hard as the district Bible quiz coordinator to equip all the quizzers not just his own team.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We almost lost to our second team at Regionals. Pulling it off even as two of the quizzers on our team went out backwards. As a coach/mom with kids on both teams it was a nail biter!
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We don't have one from this year, but a couple of years ago the captain of the other team was contesting an answer that James gave. "Clearly the quizzer said, 'harrrmmffffpppppphhhhh...'" It was at a league meet and everyone in the room started laughing except the quiz master who was "clearly" confused.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1 Cor. 9:26: Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air.

* **Team History**\
Lexington has sent twelve teams to nationals since 1996. They were also the national champions in 1997. Our team has enjoyed several aspects of Nationals. Playing games in the hallways with other teams. Competition at this level. Touring the different parts of the country. Car rides. But of all the times I've attended two as a coach, two times have stood out. The first being the time we were robbed and everything was stolen from our van. The Bible Quiz Ministry took an offering for our two teams and blessed us with more than enough to buy all that was needed for this trip and the mission trip we were heading to the day after Nationals. We had money left over and we used that to purchase baskets to give to everyone at Nationals when it came to Lexington. We felt so loved during a stressful time. The second time that stood out was the cruise in Seattle. Seeing quizzers enjoy the sunset, some worshiping -some talking, some playing cards.... it was a taste of heaven.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had different combination's of kids every time, but overtime matches are always exciting. We had several all year.
* **Favorite contest**\
My quizzers' favorite contest is when they get to contest on behalf of the other team when an official ruled the other team wrong and we can help defend their answer.
* **Favorite Question**\
A mile long question asking which chapters shared section titles.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
  * 1 Cor 12:18
  * 1 Cor 16:14
  * 2 Cor 3:17
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * Atlanta Open
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
This can be something that happened in a church van, in a hotel room, etc.- Our team stayed at a lake house at Regionals it was such a blessing.Other answers from various quizzers: listening to Geddy and Billy quoting in princess voices, hanging with quizzers at Panera, speed boat last year on the Dells, Stone Mountain.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Witnessing at the UK concession

* **Team History**\
This church has been to nationals five times previously (1998-2001 and 2003).
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At District Finals we were playing White Cloud. Neither team had any losses yet. Whitney got 2 of the 30 pt. questions incorrect and had 3 10 pt. correct. She quizzed out with only 60 points. We still managed to take 1st at District Finals when Caedy nailed the last question to win the game.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The quizmaster (at Regionals) misread a question, (completely botched it up) but didn't call the misread (but we still love her ;-). The other team interrupted and answered correctly. When our team called "Contest" the quizmaster immediately said, "Contest accepted."
* **Favorite quiz question**\
What were Damascus citizens called?
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * Whitney: 2 Cor. 7:1

* **Team History**\
Jonathan and Makena quizzed at Regionals last year where we lost three play-off rounds and obviously didn't make it to Nationals. Both quizzers were not nearly as well prepared last year and have worked hard to make it happen this year. We did wind up tied for 6th this year but won the play-off with Lexington #1 (I think they were actually the #2 Lexington team). While I didn't expect to make it to Nationals, my quizzers really wanted to and worked very hard to be in the position to recieve a wild card. We are really pleased and excited for the opportunity to go. We had a very good year this year in League quizzing. We took first in our league but at District Finals, Lafayette, Indiana (our chief rival) played great at Districts and won first. We were actually given a wildcard to Regionals as we were the 4th place team in Indiana. We lost at Regionals to the 5th place team from Indiana who also recieved a wildcard but we beat Lafayette, Lakeview and Munster (they all beat us at District) to move ahead of them at the Great Lakes Region. We went to two Invitationals this year but were only about 50/50 in the win column. We did win a few big matches this year though. At the Gobblefest, we beat Sarver (usually they mop the floor with us) but we won on the last question. At the Great Lakes Region we beat Lexington's teams for the first time in some time. We won on the last question against their top team and edged their second team both in the round robin and in a playoff. We have not beaten Lexington very many times over the years so that was exciting as they are a team we look up to and like a lot.\
\
This team is one of the most fun I have ever coached. All year long I have basically asked them to just "learn the material". Makena would ask, "Do you think we can make it to Nationals?" I would just say do the work and any thing is possible. I didn't want to pressure them into working for "Nationals" so I just kept telling them that if they worked hard anything could happen. I think I missed more practices this year than these quizzers did combined. They always came excited and motivated. Not always ready but mostly they came prepared. It is great to see them make it to Nationals because I wasn't driving them to do it. I just wanted them to learn the material and see what happens. I don't think I can point to any one verse that these kids like. There are chapters they don't like as well as others but I think that is because they are still a weakness for them.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The most exciting match of the year had to be against Lexington. I hope when or if they read this they don't take offense but we really have not done well against them and it was great to get a win. It could be that Lexington wasn't up on their game that round as that happens sometimes too but you take what you can in this type of situation. The fact that it went down to the last question showed me that my team was interrupting well and competing which was real important for us.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
On the first question of the play-off for sixth place at Great Lakes: My number three quizzer had a great hit on a ten point question. I don't even remember the question but she finished it and answered and they counted her wrong. After the re-read she was doing her confer and I was thinking that I am going to have to initiate a contest but as soon as time was called she called for the contest and we were both thinking the same thing. We presented the contest (Kenadee wouldn't do it so I had to) and we got it.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
Only one verse contains dashes. Give this verse.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Gobblefest]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/gobblefest.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
There are just to many good times with this team to pick one out. I really like working with them and they are very easy to coach.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
I know that all of my quizzers are Christians and we have talked about our lives as Christians and how we live in the world but I can't point to any one instance to bring up right now. I appreciate these kids and their witness. I also have to say that I have the best parents in the world as they have been and are still a tremendous support to me.

* **Team History**\
Lexington has sent twelve teams to nationals since 1996. They were also the national champions in 1997. Our team has enjoyed several aspects of Nationals. Playing games in the hallways with other teams. Competition at this level. Touring the different parts of the country. Car rides. But of all the times I've attended two as a coach, two times have stood out. The first being the time we were robbed and everything was stolen from our van. The Bible Quiz Ministry took an offering for our two teams and blessed us with more than enough to buy all that was needed for this trip and the mission trip we were heading to the day after Nationals. We had money left over and we used that to purchase baskets to give to everyone at Nationals when it came to Lexington. We felt so loved during a stressful time. The second time that stood out was the cruise in Seattle. Seeing quizzers enjoy the sunset, some worshiping -some talking, some playing cards.... it was a taste of heaven.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had different combination's of kids every time, but overtime matches are always exciting. We had several all year.
* **Favorite contest**\
My quizzers' favorite contest is when they get to contest on behalf of the other team when an official ruled the other team wrong and we can help defend their answer.
* **Favorite Question**\
A mile long question asking which chapters shared section titles.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * 1 Cor 12:18
  * 1 Cor 16:14
  * 2 Cor 3:17
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * Atlanta Open
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
This can be something that happened in a church van, in a hotel room, etc.- Our team stayed at a lake house at Regionals it was such a blessing.Other answers from various quizzers: listening to Geddy and Billy quoting in princess voices, hanging with quizzers at Panera, speed boat last year on the Dells, Stone Mountain.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Witnessing at the UK concession
