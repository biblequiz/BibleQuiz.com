The 48th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 5-9, 2010 in Troy, Michigan at the Marriott Hotel covering epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Richard Ely was the official question writer. This was the fourth year in which Richard wrote questions, having previously written from 2005 to 2007.

The national championship was won by Victorious Life Church, Wesley Chapel, FL (pictured). This was the first win for an eastern region since 1997 and the first win for the Southeast region since 1991, when Wesley Chapel's coach, Joshua Weber, was on a team from Lakeland, FL that won back-to-back nationals.

This year a new format was used to determine the national champion. The top four teams at the end of the regular round-robin were seeded 1 through 4 in a Final Four playoff match. Those teams were: 1. Owasso, OK, 2. Garfield, NJ, 3. Wesley Chapel, FL, 4. Bothell, WA. On Thursday morning, Owasso beat Bothell and Wesley Chapel beat Garfield in the semi-final matches. Garfield then beat Bothell for third place and Wesley Chapel beat Owasso for the championship. The matches were streamed over the internet and can be seen by clicking the "memories" link above.

The challenger division was won by First A/G of Greater Lansing, East Lansing, MI, who tied with First A/G, Montgomery, AL in the round-robin but beat them in head-to-head competition.

This marks the seventh overall year in which the Southeast region has won nationals. In addition to Wesley Chapel coach, Joshua Weber, former national champion Mark Gilmer, from Decatur, GA (now Snellville) was in attendance as well.

The top scorer at the 2010 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the second consecutive and fifth overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). This was also the first time a female has been top quizzer since 1995. Abby's per quiz average was 118.16. Second high scorer was James Lex from Cumming, GA. James was last year's second high scorer as well. Jacob Wyatt from Champaign, IL was third high scorer. Rounding out the top five were brothers Daniel Wagner (4th) and Jesse Wagner (5th) who finished only five points apart.

The individual tournament was won by Abby Rogers as well. This was the tenth time the individual tournament was won by a member of the national championship team. To finish up her complete domination of the individual quizzing this year, Abby also won the quoting bee. To top it all off, on Friday Abby coached the team that won the adult quiz competition.

While there was no official east-west at the banquet, hundreds of people crowded into a very small room after the banquet to watch a best 2 out of 3 East vs. West series. The first two rounds were split by east and west, using unused playoff sets by Richard Ely. The final game was won by the West on a set written by Central A/G coach Richard Fair consisting of 10 20's and 10 30's. The 20's were normal 20's, but the 30's were extremely hard, culminating in graduating senior James Lex quoting all of 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 in just under 30 seconds. The first match started around 10 PM and the last one finished just before 1 AM! We are in the process of getting videos from these matches.

* **Most exciting match this season**\
Probably the match against Overland Park KS at the James River Tournament. A great match, back and forth the whole way, which was eventually called due to the time limit.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Successfully arguing the difference between 'free man' and 'freedman'. Also winning, or successfully rebutting, contests based on grammar rules including: punctuation, double negatives, capitalization, and verb vs. adjective.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
20 points S&Q GCA from 2CV. Many questions say that Paul's writings and teachings were true. What was actually true? 1C5:1-2
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1C4:9-13 & 20
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})

  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
All the discussion that we've had due to the way questions are worded and through our memorization of the scripture. You would be surprised and shocked at the deep theological issues we create and deal with. Also, the craziness of driving into Philadelphia to run the Rocky steps and eat Philly cheesesteaks....Oh the memories....
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
We go as a team to the Bowling Green Courthouse to read/recite God's Word on the courthouse steps during the week leading up to the National Day of Prayer. We have also been able to apply the scripture in daily life and conversation to great effect.

* **Team History**\
Our team moved from California to Michigan. This will be our fifth trip to Nationals. Three years in California as Orange Hills and now our second trip as New Life Assembly in White Cloud Michigan. We are pretty excited that Michigan is hosting Nationals this year! Our team originally was part of Santa Ana's team but we left that church. Thankfully Irv Kuroishi had done a good job teaching our quizzers James and Mary- they in turn taught us the game. Irv helped us with study material our first year to Nationals. He worked hard as the district Bible quiz coordinator to equip all the quizzers not just his own team.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We almost lost to our second team at Regionals. Pulling it off even as two of the quizzers on our team went out backwards. As a coach/mom with kids on both teams it was a nail biter!
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We don't have one from this year, but a couple of years ago the captain of the other team was contesting an answer that James gave. "Clearly the quizzer said, 'harrrmmffffpppppphhhhh...'" It was at a league meet and everyone in the room started laughing except the quiz master who was "clearly" confused.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1 Cor. 9:26: Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air.

* **Team History**\
Lexington has sent twelve teams to nationals since 1996. They were also the national champions in 1997. Our team has enjoyed several aspects of Nationals. Playing games in the hallways with other teams. Competition at this level. Touring the different parts of the country. Car rides. But of all the times I've attended two as a coach, two times have stood out. The first being the time we were robbed and everything was stolen from our van. The Bible Quiz Ministry took an offering for our two teams and blessed us with more than enough to buy all that was needed for this trip and the mission trip we were heading to the day after Nationals. We had money left over and we used that to purchase baskets to give to everyone at Nationals when it came to Lexington. We felt so loved during a stressful time. The second time that stood out was the cruise in Seattle. Seeing quizzers enjoy the sunset, some worshiping -some talking, some playing cards.... it was a taste of heaven.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had different combination's of kids every time, but overtime matches are always exciting. We had several all year.
* **Favorite contest**\
My quizzers' favorite contest is when they get to contest on behalf of the other team when an official ruled the other team wrong and we can help defend their answer.
* **Favorite Question**\
A mile long question asking which chapters shared section titles.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
  * 1 Cor 12:18
  * 1 Cor 16:14
  * 2 Cor 3:17
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * [Atlanta Open]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/mark-gilmer-atlanta-open.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
This can be something that happened in a church van, in a hotel room, etc.- Our team stayed at a lake house at Regionals it was such a blessing.Other answers from various quizzers: listening to Geddy and Billy quoting in princess voices, hanging with quizzers at Panera, speed boat last year on the Dells, Stone Mountain.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Witnessing at the UK concession

At District Finals we were playing White Cloud. Neither team had any losses yet. Whitney got 2 of the 30 pt. questions incorrect and had 3 10 pt. correct. She quizzed out with only 60 points. We still managed to take 1st at District Finals when Caedy nailed the last question to win the game.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The quizmaster (at Regionals) misread a question, (completely botched it up) but didn't call the misread (but we still love her ;-). The other team interrupted and answered correctly. When our team called "Contest" the quizmaster immediately said, "Contest accepted."

* **Team History**\
Jonathan and Makena quizzed at Regionals last year where we lost three play-off rounds and obviously didn't make it to Nationals. Both quizzers were not nearly as well prepared last year and have worked hard to make it happen this year. We did wind up tied for 6th this year but won the play-off with Lexington #1 (I think they were actually the #2 Lexington team). While I didn't expect to make it to Nationals, my quizzers really wanted to and worked very hard to be in the position to recieve a wild card. We are really pleased and excited for the opportunity to go. We had a very good year this year in League quizzing. We took first in our league but at District Finals, Lafayette, Indiana (our chief rival) played great at Districts and won first. We were actually given a wildcard to Regionals as we were the 4th place team in Indiana. We lost at Regionals to the 5th place team from Indiana who also recieved a wildcard but we beat Lafayette, Lakeview and Munster (they all beat us at District) to move ahead of them at the Great Lakes Region. We went to two Invitationals this year but were only about 50/50 in the win column. We did win a few big matches this year though. At the Gobblefest, we beat Sarver (usually they mop the floor with us) but we won on the last question. At the Great Lakes Region we beat Lexington's teams for the first time in some time. We won on the last question against their top team and edged their second team both in the round robin and in a playoff. We have not beaten Lexington very many times over the years so that was exciting as they are a team we look up to and like a lot.\
\
This team is one of the most fun I have ever coached. All year long I have basically asked them to just "learn the material". Makena would ask, "Do you think we can make it to Nationals?" I would just say do the work and any thing is possible. I didn't want to pressure them into working for "Nationals" so I just kept telling them that if they worked hard anything could happen. I think I missed more practices this year than these quizzers did combined. They always came excited and motivated. Not always ready but mostly they came prepared. It is great to see them make it to Nationals because I wasn't driving them to do it. I just wanted them to learn the material and see what happens. I don't think I can point to any one verse that these kids like. There are chapters they don't like as well as others but I think that is because they are still a weakness for them.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The most exciting match of the year had to be against Lexington. I hope when or if they read this they don't take offense but we really have not done well against them and it was great to get a win. It could be that Lexington wasn't up on their game that round as that happens sometimes too but you take what you can in this type of situation. The fact that it went down to the last question showed me that my team was interrupting well and competing which was real important for us.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
On the first question of the play-off for sixth place at Great Lakes: My number three quizzer had a great hit on a ten point question. I don't even remember the question but she finished it and answered and they counted her wrong. After the re-read she was doing her confer and I was thinking that I am going to have to initiate a contest but as soon as time was called she called for the contest and we were both thinking the same thing. We presented the contest (Kenadee wouldn't do it so I had to) and we got it.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
Only one verse contains dashes. Give this verse.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Gobblefest]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/gobblefest.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
There are just to many good times with this team to pick one out. I really like working with them and they are very easy to coach.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
I know that all of my quizzers are Christians and we have talked about our lives as Christians and how we live in the world but I can't point to any one instance to bring up right now. I appreciate these kids and their witness. I also have to say that I have the best parents in the world as they have been and are still a tremendous support to me.

* **Team History**\
Lexington has sent twelve teams to nationals since 1996. They were also the national champions in 1997. Our team has enjoyed several aspects of Nationals. Playing games in the hallways with other teams. Competition at this level. Touring the different parts of the country. Car rides. But of all the times I've attended two as a coach, two times have stood out. The first being the time we were robbed and everything was stolen from our van. The Bible Quiz Ministry took an offering for our two teams and blessed us with more than enough to buy all that was needed for this trip and the mission trip we were heading to the day after Nationals. We had money left over and we used that to purchase baskets to give to everyone at Nationals when it came to Lexington. We felt so loved during a stressful time. The second time that stood out was the cruise in Seattle. Seeing quizzers enjoy the sunset, some worshiping -some talking, some playing cards.... it was a taste of heaven.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had different combination's of kids every time, but overtime matches are always exciting. We had several all year.
* **Favorite contest**\
My quizzers' favorite contest is when they get to contest on behalf of the other team when an official ruled the other team wrong and we can help defend their answer.
* **Favorite Question**\
A mile long question asking which chapters shared section titles.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * 1 Cor 12:18
  * 1 Cor 16:14

  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
This can be something that happened in a church van, in a hotel room, etc.- Our team stayed at a lake house at Regionals it was such a blessing.Other answers from various quizzers: listening to Geddy and Billy quoting in princess voices, hanging with quizzers at Panera, speed boat last year on the Dells, Stone Mountain.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\

* **Team History**\
Prior to this year, James River has sent thirteen teams to nationals since 2001, with five of them placing in the top three. This is the first national finals for these quizzers.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At Regionals we played in the championship playoff round against our other James River team. We played extremely well, and won the game, securing the Regional title. For a group of quizzers who have never quizzed at Nationals before, this was very exciting.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We had a very long and drawn out contest against Ash Grove at Districts involving grammar, verbs, and subordinate clauses. Joshua Havens matched Karl in the confusing argument department, and sadly, our contest was denied. We were able to laugh about it quite a lot. Also, at Regionals, Karl was on prescription painkillers and was attempting to give a rebuttal about what the opposing quizzer from Central said. Karl actually said, "I'm pretty high right now, but I'm pretty sure he said..." The best part was that Darin Poe, the So. MO DYD was watching the game. The second best part was that we won the contest.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
From Joey Bohanon's practice questions:\
The motion pictures Star Trek II and Star Trek III explore which is better: the good of the one, or the good of the many. According to Paul, which was more important?
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
2 Corinthians 12:9: "But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me."

Our team has done a lot of quoting in front of groups outside the church, and thus has shared the benefits of the BQ ministry with a wide audience.

They were the first team to appear at nationals for an entire cycle, from 1986 to 1993. They also went in 1995, sent two teams in 1996, went in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001 and every year since 2008. Former team members include two top scorers, Jhan Hurst and Marcae Johnson, as well as Karl Dawson and website administrator Joey Bohanon. Central placed third in 1976, 1987, 1996 and 2000 and second in 1988 and 1997.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had a match early this season against Christian Temple from Houston, TX at the Gold Cup tournament in Dallas. We had made several mistakes early, and subsequently we need the last 5 questions for a double-quizout to win. We were able to get the win and were very excited.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
I believe it involved a Hindrance contest at the Houston tournament against Briargate. There was something about a floor-waxing machine that looks like a Zamboni. Briargate contested the hindrance and didn't get it.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Application Question-What do Christians smell like?
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * Brianna: 1C 15:57
  * Emily: 2C 11:12
  * Matthew: 1C 1:8

  * [Owasso Xtreme]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/owasso-xtreme.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
We ran into a median after the Houston tournament on our way to go bowling. No one was hurt, but we did have to report the accident to our church as we were in a church vehicle.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Many of the kids have used their Scriptural knowledge to support their faith when engaged in conversation with friends, family, or acquaintances. One particular example occurred when Matthew was quoting at the public library and was able to share the gospel with a library worker who later committed their life to the Lord.

* **Most exciting match this season**\
At districts we played JR "Perfect in Weakness" and we were winning but it was still close at the 19th question and we discovered that there was a buzzer that wasn't working. So we had to replay up to question 16, but we ended up winning this hard fought match.

In 2008, we went as a two man team to Green Bay and ranked 2nd to last (Chariton, IA). This year we are finally bringing a full team to Nationals in Deeeeetroit.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Our most exciting match was against Moberly, Missouri (coached by my former coach, Randy Lee) at the 2010 NC Regionals. We were 8 and 1 and trying to hang on to our 1st place ranking. On question 10 we used our last timeout and were down 85 to (-15). We ended up winning the match 120 to 70 on the last question. And yes, our teams are still on speaking terms. We went to lunch together that same day.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The question was: give the verse that mentions a haircut. The other team quoted a verse that mentions a head being shaved. We had to convince the judges that a haircut was something altogether different than a hair "shave."
* **Favorite question**\
Give the 19 questions in 1 Corinthians 9.

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Jonathan quoted 1 Corinthians 15 during a Sunday evening service at Berean (approximately 200 in attendance). He quoted slow and articulate until he got to the last section, at which point he put his quoting into overdrive and therefore mostly unintelligible. He got a standing "O."
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
My wife and use Bible quiz as a ministry tool to teach and train the kids we have adopted over the years, many of whom have come from a non-church background. (ie. our 14 year old daugher Anna Plank memorized 1 Corinthians this year. We adopted her last July.)

Cedar Rapids got the question and it was ruled correct. Our team contested and it was accepted. Then the other team contested and it was denied. We got a re-read and won the match.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The team's favorite contest was the one in the match against Cedar Rapids, IA (mentioned as one of the most exciting matches). We needed to get the last question, which was a 20 pointer, to win. After Cedar Rapids got it correct, Ross called sort of a "desperation contest" because the quizzer added a few words to his answer that may have been incorrect. The coach agreed to contest the answer and the contest was accepted!
* **Favorite question**\
At the Mid-Winter Classic, Tyler Turnage was the question writer (he also happens to be a die-hard Vikings fan). For the first 4 matches, the 4th question of the match was a question about Brett Farve.\
\
One of Nathan's favorite questions from Regionals was 'Give in essence the verses that say Paul preached the gospel, quote, "free of charge"' because it was on the list of concordance material that he had studied.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * Ross: 1 Corinthians 15:1
  * Nathan: 1 Corinthans 15:57 or 1 Corinthians 1:3-4
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})
  * [Mid-Winter Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/mid-winter-classic.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
After the River Classic going to eat at Lamberts and roller skating. Also, everyone playing Mario Kart together in the church van when we travel to tournaments.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
For Nathan there have been situations which have come up where scriptures he has studied currently or in the past, comes to mind to assist him with that situation. Sometimes it could be a personal situation or a class topic. It is also neat for him to see that events he is involved in this year have integrated some of the Corinthian scriptures (the Fine Arts theme came from 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Royal Rangers from 2 Corinthians 10:4).

* **Team History**\
This will be the third time the Swordmasters (aka "Bringers of Cookies") have been to National finals. A highlight being that they went undefeated at Regionals in '09.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
A match that sticks in our memory, would be at Regionals: A quizzer on the other team had blundered on kind of an obvious question, so when conferring, he lamented by calling himself a doofus. His brother reassuringly said "You're not a-- well, you are a doofus, but it's okay."
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Our contesting skills could use work, but we've been mastering the art of the rebuttal. Our favorites have become, "You shouldn't give this to them, because they're evil!" and "They're just jealous of our hair."
* **Favorite question**\
Favorite question this year would be at Regionals where the quizzer had to quote the verse that mentioned a hair cut.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
By far, our favorite team verse would be 2nd Corinthians 12:1a. "I must go on boasting."
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Berean Family Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/berean-family-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
On the way back from Regionals we were playing the alphabet game, (sort of like Johnny's Pocket or Going to Grandma's House). Luke, who had scorekept for us and is basically a walking encyclopedia, put in the dinosaur named Dodoricus. After many questions about it, he sounded it out for us mortals as "DO-DOR-I-CUS." Of course, who could resist over-pronouncing this every time it came up in the game? Luke bore it fairly patiently, even when he later had to admit that he had goofed and the actual word was Doedicurus. We love you, Luke.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
All the practical times we've found to quote 2nd Corinthians 12:1a.

* **Team History**\
The ministry at Word of Life was started in 2007 with a vision to "hide" God's Word in the hearts of our youth and to provide spiritual mentoring for both our middle and high school youth. It was a natural extension from JBQ which we started in 2006. We really want to see the next generation assume the spiritual "mantle" and have a double blessing and anointing in fulfilling the Great Commission. In our first year (GEPCP), we learned very early on that we were in over our heads. Although we were coached by a former and successful Penn-Del quizzer Beth Reynolds, it was our first year and it would be a while before our youth learned the rules and mechanics of the competition. During that same year we were joined by Don York and Sam York from Cornerstone A/G in Bowie, Md, which added a Nationals-level Coach and another strong quizzer to our team. We made it to Regionals in our first year but we lost handily to the more experienced teams at Regionals. In our second year (Mark) we made it to Regionals and finished 6th -- after a playoff match to determine the 5th place for Nationals. This, our 3rd year (1/2 Corinthians), we finished a strong 4th and qualified for Nationals for the very first time in Word of Life history. Praise to His Name!!!
* **Most exciting match this season**\
This year at Regionals we lost a round on the last question, which if we had gotten it, we would have placed 2nd instead of 4th.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
There are so many favorites but here's one: 1 Corinthians 13:13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * Empire Classic

  * [Three Rivers]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/three-rivers-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Returning from Friendship, we almost ran out of gas in the mountains of Pennsylvania. A check of the nearest gas station on our GPS indicated about 12 miles to go. We really prayed and we made it with just enough gas to spare!!!

* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
A quizzer on the other team was answering a quote and said "cupper" instead of supper. The officials (who were laughing) originally ruled correct. I was about to take a 5pt foul and call contest and all 3 of my quizzers at table yelled contest. The whole time Kayla was giving the contest the rest of us were hysterical. The other team tried arguing the new quotation rule, but even 1 or more teammates turned and said, "You said cupper!" We have no idea why they ruled correct, but we won the contest.

* **Team History**\
Cedar Park has sent at least one team to Nationals for 13 consecutive years. The highest finish was 1st place in 2005; combined with a 4th place finish in 2004 and a four-year string of 2nd place finishes from 2006-2009, that makes 6 consecutive years finishing in the trophy round. I believe Cedar Park also has the distinction of being the only church to place two teams in the top ten in the same year, with a 1st-and-10th finish in 2005. Finally, Cedar Park holds the record for the only "perfect match" recorded at Nationals: all four quizzers quizzed out positively in a single match during the first day of competition in 2008.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At Regionals, we were down by 90 to Nyssa, OR, with five questions (three 10's and two 20's) remaining, needing to get all the remaining questions and a quiz-out. We got the first four, with Flynn and Heather each getting two and Heather quizzing out on the 19th, and almost pulled off the come-back, but Melissa Larson, Nyssa's top quizzer, won the battle of speed on question 20 and we lost 160-140.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**
  * Most clever: Heather was arguing the correctness of her completion of a question and did something I had not seen a quizzer do before: she quoted a renowned New Testament scholar (Gordon Fee, whose study materials we had been using in our Sunday School sessions). Her exact line was: "And you need to realize that in chapter 4 of 1 Corinthians Paul is using a great deal of irony -- or, as Fee would say, 'God-inspired sarcasm.'" And then she went right on...it was great! Kari later had opportunity to relate the story to Dr. Fee: he asked if she had won the contest, and when he learned she had not, said, "You should send a copy of my commentary to the judges." =)
  * Least clever: Flynn was arguing the correctness of his answer on a quotation question which the judges had ruled incorrect. Unfortunately, he made the same mistake reiterating his answer as he did when he originally gave it, thereby solidifying the case against him.
  * Most confused: Kari was arguing the correctness of Flynn's answer, and then of his completion of the question, but on the second issue she inadvertently reversed the facts and was actually arguing the opposing case, until Heather managed to non-verbally make her aware of it. At that point, Kari said, "On the other hand..." and completely changed her argument to the other way around! Come to find out, the judges were not concerned about his completion, anyway; the contest was accepted about his answer. =)
* **Favorite question**\
Our favorite has to be the one from which we derive our name. Kari was reading this 10-pointer at practice. It was a "blind" 10-pointer and Rachel interrupted at the right spot: "What far outweighs..." Kari thought it was a fairly straightforward interruption and was wondering why Rachel wasn't completing it, then noticed that the other quizzers also looked confused. The explanation: while Kari had read "What far outweighs...," the quizzers had heard "What far-out ways..."! When we discovered the offending homonyms we had a pretty good laugh, particularly as poor Rachel was very studiously trying to think if Paul had any far-out ways of doing things!
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
2 Corinthians 12:9-10: But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

  * [Snake River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/snake-river-classic.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Flynn's "head-banging" act, trying to get Ani and Adi to get 1 Corinthians 14:24 in Bible Quiz Charades. Also, a whole host of "Catch Phrase" laughs from the night after the River Classic tournament when we stayed up playing until the wee hours!
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Rachel has made the most of her opportunities: she was able to share Paul's warning about bad company corrupting good character with a friend who was making some poor choices in relationships. She also was quoting to her grandmother while walking through a mall and had opportunity to share with a woman who asked what they were doing.

* **Team History**\
Owasso has been blessed to send a team to Nationals the past 4 seasons. The past 2 seasons, we've won the National Championship, going 55-1 in the process.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The match against Overland Park at Regionals. Very tight match the whole way through. Daniel had two wrong after four questions, but still continued to fight and make great hits throughout the game. Near the end of the game, Ariel had quizzed out and none of our guys had. Luke made a great hit on the 18th question, a ten pointer, and got us up by 5 points. Question 19 comes for twenty points. Jesse makes a top notch interruption and gets it right to seal the game. On question 20 Daniel even got the quiz out, battling back from having no right and two wrong very early in the match. It won us Regionals, allowing us to 3-peat as South Central Champs. I don't think that's ever been done before in our Region.\
(Inserted by the webmaster: Bartlesville, OK accomplished this from 1992 to 1994)
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Nothing too ingenious this season, although we have hotly debated whether the Holy Spirit is a what, a whom or both multiple times this season.
* **Favorite questions**\
Any, and all, of Joey Bohanon's Statement and Quotation questions!
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**:
  * Jesse: 1 Corinthians 10:13

Jesse and Daniel drove down to the Houston Tourney with Greg House and his team, stayed in a hotel room that weekend with Steve Fowler, and were guest-coached by Bryan Turner! Needless to say (but we'll say it anyway!), they had a blast hanging out with those Bible Quiz "greats"!

* **Team History**\
Last year in Novice the team took 1st in both the "Missouri Classic" and "Owasso Extreme" tournaments. At the 2009 South Central Regionals (without Paul Meddaugh) the team took 2nd. We feel blessed that we get to come to TBQ Nationals this year. This is our first year is A-League and the team has done very well. Thanks to Owasso for letting us quiz (and mentor us) every Monday night. Thanks to Zach Sullivan and Cheri Smith for your Bible Quiz training.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The 2nd round of Regions was with Highpointe from (OKC,OK). Paul fizzed out and David quizzed out giving us 105 with Highpointe with only 80. The match was on Question 19 for the 20 points. Micah Samuelson from Highpointe has a good hit and he gets all of the question read to him. If Micah Samuelson answers it, he will quiz out and we loose the match. Micah Samuelson was the 2nd best quizzers at regions this year. The time started ticking down..... Micah says nothing. Tick,tick..................................... I'm thinking "Is he going to say something". Tick,tick............................................................beep! We won. Now, this is not the way I like to win a match. I the coach wanted to put as the most exciting match was when we beat Breaswood in the playoffs. My quizzers said that the playoff match was a great match but the most exciting match was with Highpointe.

* **Team History**\
This is our second year with Senior Bible Quiz, 1st year at Nationals. As our children were growing out of JBQ- Daniel and Krystal Mims (Montgomery First, Alabama) were patient and kind enough to share quizzing wisdom and encouragement with both myself and my team. This year, Ashland's JBQ team and our SBQ team were blessed to attend Nationals. I coached both - All things are possible through Him!\
\
We were invited to Nationals as a wild card invitation. Needless to say, it was not in the budget. Our Church body and Community lovingly responded with the most generous donations to get us here. We are so very grateful.\
\
On the way to JBQ Nationals this year, our 13 year old buzzer system was stolen out of our car - along with our library cards, Katie's schoolbooks, lots of God's Word and a box of snotty tissues. We keep our buzzer system in a casserole dish cover :). They left the cash. During the awards ceremony, one of the vendors decided not to have a drawing as he had planned. He BLESSED us with a whole new system! God rocks!
* **Most Exciting Match This Season**\
Play off Match at Regionals this year with Snellville, Ga.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
Who died?
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Broom-ball at Southeast Regionals.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
We always enjoy sharing about Quiz with both believers and unbelievers as we travel. We had a very special moment this summer. We were in Texas and stopped for dinner. We got to know a older gentleman who had just left a Bible class - he started to pick random verses for the kids to quote and he got such an excited and joyous look on his face as he said the words along with the kids. I believe we planted a seed of hope with him about the legacy of Christ and young people. Maybe a new team?

#### 1st Place

* **Church**: The Church at Briargate, Colorado Springs, CO
* **Coaches**:
  * Greg House: Involved in Bible Quiz since 1980. He quizzed for one year as a senior in high school, then went on to coach, officiate, and write official questions. At the end of this season he will have coached 16 times at national finals, winning 5 national championships at 3 separate churches (both records), and finishing 2nd twice. His 1999 team won the national championship and both individual titles, also setting records for team average (278.48), margin of victory (243.70), individual average (Kent - 152.17), and individual quiz outs (Kent - 22). His 2003 team set a record at national finals - it was Orange Hills A/G's third win at national finals, all of which were undefeated, and all 3 wins happened within a 4 year period. At nationals, he has coached 2 individual high scorers (Kent Piacenti & David Dorey) and 4 individual competition champions (Dan Smith twice, Kent Piacenti, and Peter Brown). He says his favorite Briargate coaching experience was watching his "rag-tag" 2005-06 team constantly progress in skill, knowledge, and friendship together, finally ending with Molly Pace answering her final BQ question ever with the verse that contained our team name and clinching the national championship. His favorite/most nerve-wracking Briargate coaching moment(s) were watching Andrew Kelley win four games on the last question at nationals in 2007 to clinch the national title.
  * Evelyn Oss (assistant): Involved in Bible Quiz since 2007 as a novice team coach, and one of the best ones I have ever worked with. In 2009 & 2010, her team was the regional champion. Her three daughters (see below), have all participated in both Novice and Teen Quiz. This year the Briargate team is composed entirely of her three children and she very active as the assistant coach by holding extra practices, listening to quoting, and driving the church van on all our trips. The truth is that without her my back would not have held up to finish out the quiz year.
* **Team**:
    * Ellen Oss: Third year to quiz at National Finals. She has received her NMA and is the team captain. Her favorite quiz moment this year was defeating the Wagner boys three games in a row in the Gold Cup individual competition to be the individual competition champion.
    * Amie Oss: First year to quiz at National Finals, having moved up this year after an undefeated record and high scorer honors in novice quiz at the Southwest regional finals in 2009. She has received her NMA. Her favorite quiz moment(s) this year were winning both District and Regional Finals as the "underdog" team.
    * Caroline Oss: First year she has ever quizzed, starting the year in novice quiz and moving up to the top team in February to quiz with her sisters. Starting on the top team in February, Caroline memorized 2nd Corinthians in time to receive her NMA. Her favorite quiz moment this year was quizzing for the first time ever in the A division at the South Texas Invitational and finishing individual 10th high scorer.

* **Team History**\
Starting as a church "plant" from Radiant Church in 2001, Briargate has sent a team to national finals both that year and every year since. Winning the national championships in 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Briargate holds the record for most championships. Briargate's win in 2007 tied Colorado for the record for state wins with California at 7 each, and was the 18th year that a team from the Southwest Region won national finals, besting the next place region by 11 championships. From 2001 through 2010, Briargate has sent a total of 17 teams to national finals and holds the following national finals records:
  * Most National Championships
  * Most National Championships by a single quizzer (David Dorey with 4)
  * Second Most National Championships by a single quizzer (Molly Pace with 3)
  * Longest Individual Winning Streak by a quizzer (David Dorey won 54 consecutive games at national finals from 2001 - 2004)
  * First ever mother-daughter win at national finals (Jodi Heugel won in 1977 and her daughter, Jordan Schneider, won in 2001)
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Beating Fort Collins, CO in the last round at regionals to determine the regional champion.
* **Favorite contest**\
Is there really any way to pick just one? Our favorites are when the rebutting team clearly did not understand our contest and their rebuttal backs up what we just said - it's even more powerful than saying "no rebuttal."
* **Favorite Question**\
Joey Bohanon's "Statement and Question" questions are usually the most weirdly funny. Lamest question - verse with four dashes - come on, I personally wrote about 8000 of 12,500 questions for the official writing team the last time we covered these books - when you start writing non-chapter analysis punctuation questions, you know you have burned out writing on these books. Our "punctuation concordance" will not be forthcoming since I know Richard Ely is a much better writer.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
Every time I teach these books (this is my 4th time), I make sure that my favorite verse ends up being the team's favorite verse:\
1st Corinthians 10:13: No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.\
This verse shuts down all the crying about being unable to stand up under temptation. No more excuses, the devil DIDN'T make you do it, and it certainly should be the end of hearing that "no one could stand up under that kind of pressure." This, along with Hebrews 4:14-16, must give us the confidence to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we can stand against sin anytime we want to - the only problem that remains is the "want to" part. Anytime we "want to", we can find grace to help us in our time of need and be sure that our spiritual nature triumphs over our sinful nature:\
Hebrews 4:14-16: Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we areyet was without sin. 16Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
O.K., the 1-10 funniest moments would be too embarrassing for the girls to make public, so here goes with #11: My team cried for weeks before regionals about the fact that we just HAD to go to the beach while at regional finals, even though it was not on our schedule (the beach is only about 10 miles straight down the freeway from where we held the competition). When we arrived at our hotel (only about 8 miles from the beach), we were meeting with quizzers and parents about our schedule, when everyone needed to be up, etc., and I was mobbed by the quizzers literally begging, with false tears I might add, to go to the beach, saying, and I quote verbatim: "It just isn't a trip to California if we don't go to the beach and build a sandcastle." I told them it was cold, really windy, and the sun would already be set by the time we reached the beach after dinner, but they insisted. After dinner, with the sun still setting against the 30-story building across from our restaurant, we jumped into the van and headed for the beach. When we arrived they looked so happy and jumped out of the van in a mild jog for their promised "utopian euphoria." I was back in the van no less than 30 seconds later. The wind was gusting up to 55 mph, blowing sand like crazy and the wind chill put the temperature somewhere around 35-40 degrees. After about 5 minutes, they all sprinted back to the van. I locked the doors and asked them if they had built a sandcastle, which they had not. I told them to go back and fulfill their "California-Dream Sandcastle" before I would let them back in, and if they didn't, they would be guilty of lying about their motives. It was clearly not **their** funniest/happiest moment, but I certainly laughed about it for a long time. And NO, I didn't force them to head back to the sand, after about 3 more minutes outside I decided I wanted to go back to the hotel and let them back in the van. No one will give me the photo for fear of where I will publish it. However, a thousand words is worth a picture.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
The girls are tireless promoters of other teens joining BQ, living what they have memorized and learned from the Scriptures, and volunteering their time and effort in the community for the homeless, hungry, and needy.

This is LHC's second year quizzing and first at Nationals. Despite its short BQ tenure, LHC boasts numerous former quizzers as church members, including its senior pastor, Phil Steiger, a quizzer in the 80s and 90s and the long-time coach of the Radiant Church/Church at Briargate team.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At Districts, we had to win our final round of regular competition against Church at Briargate to force a three-way tie for 1st. After a hard-fought match, we won, only to face Briargate again in the first round of the playoffs. Despite losing another close game, our quizzers pulled their emotions together and went on to beat Timberline to take 2nd place. It was an excellent day of quiz.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1 Corinthians 15:32: If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." We take our team name from this verse, largely because of the way we feel the day after quizzing.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Southern Fried Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/southern-fried-classic.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Our official mascot is Shaun Lind, the nearly 2-year-old son of our coaches. He loves buzzing in with the quizzers, and we recorded his first interruption and completion, largely in gibberish. In general, coaching with a toddler presents new and exciting challenges.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
As a result of Quiz, we have had numerous opportunities to discuss the Bible, church, and religion in general with unbelieving family members.

There was a simple question during a league competition that went something like, "Whose aroma are we?" David buzzed in and we all thought the question was relatively straightforward, while David sat there with a puzzled expression on his face for the entire thirty seconds. During the confer, we told him what the answer was, and he suddenly exclaimed, "OOOH! I thought the quizmaster said, 'Who's a Roman army?'"
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1 Corinthians 12:24-25 "But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the body but that its parts should have equal concern for each other."
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
In June, when we were having a break from quoting, David made up a simple but challenging game for us to play. He placed a small coffee table and an empty wastebasket in a line. The challenge was to bounce the tennis ball off the coffee table and into the wastebasket. After numerous failed attempts, David was about to give up when he decided to try once more. Before bouncing the ball off the table, he held up the ball and declared, "Or my middle name is not Yilong!" To our surprise and laughter, he finally succeeded. Then David told Tiffany to try, and she skeptically agreed. Before throwing the ball, she said, "Or my middle name is not Jessica" and lo and behold, it made it in!
