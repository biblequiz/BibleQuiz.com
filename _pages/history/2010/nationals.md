The 48th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 5-9, 2010 in Troy, Michigan at the Marriott Hotel covering epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Richard Ely was the official question writer. This was the fourth year in which Richard wrote questions, having previously written from 2005 to 2007.

The national championship was won by Victorious Life Church, Wesley Chapel, FL (pictured). This was the first win for an eastern region since 1997 and the first win for the Southeast region since 1991, when Wesley Chapel's coach, Joshua Weber, was on a team from Lakeland, FL that won back-to-back nationals.

This year a new format was used to determine the national champion. The top four teams at the end of the regular round-robin were seeded 1 through 4 in a Final Four playoff match. Those teams were: 1. Owasso, OK, 2. Garfield, NJ, 3. Wesley Chapel, FL, 4. Bothell, WA. On Thursday morning, Owasso beat Bothell and Wesley Chapel beat Garfield in the semi-final matches. Garfield then beat Bothell for third place and Wesley Chapel beat Owasso for the championship. The matches were streamed over the internet and can be seen by clicking the "memories" link above.

The challenger division was won by First A/G of Greater Lansing, East Lansing, MI, who tied with First A/G, Montgomery, AL in the round-robin but beat them in head-to-head competition.

This marks the seventh overall year in which the Southeast region has won nationals. In addition to Wesley Chapel coach, Joshua Weber, former national champion Mark Gilmer, from Decatur, GA (now Snellville) was in attendance as well.

The top scorer at the 2010 National Finals was Abby Rogers from Wesley Chapel, FL. This marks the second consecutive and fifth overall top scorer from the Southeast region (one of those being her coach, Joshua Weber, in 1992). This was also the first time a female has been top quizzer since 1995. Abby's per quiz average was 118.16. Second high scorer was James Lex from Cumming, GA. James was last year's second high scorer as well. Jacob Wyatt from Champaign, IL was third high scorer. Rounding out the top five were brothers Daniel Wagner (4th) and Jesse Wagner (5th) who finished only five points apart.

The individual tournament was won by Abby Rogers as well. This was the tenth time the individual tournament was won by a member of the national championship team. To finish up her complete domination of the individual quizzing this year, Abby also won the quoting bee. To top it all off, on Friday Abby coached the team that won the adult quiz competition.

While there was no official east-west at the banquet, hundreds of people crowded into a very small room after the banquet to watch a best 2 out of 3 East vs. West series. The first two rounds were split by east and west, using unused playoff sets by Richard Ely. The final game was won by the West on a set written by Central A/G coach Richard Fair consisting of 10 20's and 10 30's. The 20's were normal 20's, but the 30's were extremely hard, culminating in graduating senior James Lex quoting all of 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 in just under 30 seconds. The first match started around 10 PM and the last one finished just before 1 AM! We are in the process of getting videos from these matches.

* **Most exciting match this season**\
Probably the match against Overland Park KS at the James River Tournament. A great match, back and forth the whole way, which was eventually called due to the time limit.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Successfully arguing the difference between 'free man' and 'freedman'. Also winning, or successfully rebutting, contests based on grammar rules including: punctuation, double negatives, capitalization, and verb vs. adjective.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
20 points S&Q GCA from 2CV. Many questions say that Paul's writings and teachings were true. What was actually true? 1C5:1-2
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1C4:9-13 & 20
* **Tournaments attended this year**:

  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
All the discussion that we've had due to the way questions are worded and through our memorization of the scripture. You would be surprised and shocked at the deep theological issues we create and deal with. Also, the craziness of driving into Philadelphia to run the Rocky steps and eat Philly cheesesteaks....Oh the memories....
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
We go as a team to the Bowling Green Courthouse to read/recite God's Word on the courthouse steps during the week leading up to the National Day of Prayer. We have also been able to apply the scripture in daily life and conversation to great effect.

* **Team History**\
Our team moved from California to Michigan. This will be our fifth trip to Nationals. Three years in California as Orange Hills and now our second trip as New Life Assembly in White Cloud Michigan. We are pretty excited that Michigan is hosting Nationals this year! Our team originally was part of Santa Ana's team but we left that church. Thankfully Irv Kuroishi had done a good job teaching our quizzers James and Mary- they in turn taught us the game. Irv helped us with study material our first year to Nationals. He worked hard as the district Bible quiz coordinator to equip all the quizzers not just his own team.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We almost lost to our second team at Regionals. Pulling it off even as two of the quizzers on our team went out backwards. As a coach/mom with kids on both teams it was a nail biter!
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We don't have one from this year, but a couple of years ago the captain of the other team was contesting an answer that James gave. "Clearly the quizzer said, 'harrrmmffffpppppphhhhh...'" It was at a league meet and everyone in the room started laughing except the quiz master who was "clearly" confused.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
1 Cor. 9:26: Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air.

* **Team History**\
Lexington has sent twelve teams to nationals since 1996. They were also the national champions in 1997. Our team has enjoyed several aspects of Nationals. Playing games in the hallways with other teams. Competition at this level. Touring the different parts of the country. Car rides. But of all the times I've attended two as a coach, two times have stood out. The first being the time we were robbed and everything was stolen from our van. The Bible Quiz Ministry took an offering for our two teams and blessed us with more than enough to buy all that was needed for this trip and the mission trip we were heading to the day after Nationals. We had money left over and we used that to purchase baskets to give to everyone at Nationals when it came to Lexington. We felt so loved during a stressful time. The second time that stood out was the cruise in Seattle. Seeing quizzers enjoy the sunset, some worshiping -some talking, some playing cards.... it was a taste of heaven.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had different combination's of kids every time, but overtime matches are always exciting. We had several all year.
* **Favorite contest**\
My quizzers' favorite contest is when they get to contest on behalf of the other team when an official ruled the other team wrong and we can help defend their answer.
* **Favorite Question**\
A mile long question asking which chapters shared section titles.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
  * 1 Cor 12:18
  * 1 Cor 16:14
  * 2 Cor 3:17
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})
  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * Atlanta Open
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
This can be something that happened in a church van, in a hotel room, etc.- Our team stayed at a lake house at Regionals it was such a blessing.Other answers from various quizzers: listening to Geddy and Billy quoting in princess voices, hanging with quizzers at Panera, speed boat last year on the Dells, Stone Mountain.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Witnessing at the UK concession

* **Team History**\
This church has been to nationals five times previously (1998-2001 and 2003).
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At District Finals we were playing White Cloud. Neither team had any losses yet. Whitney got 2 of the 30 pt. questions incorrect and had 3 10 pt. correct. She quizzed out with only 60 points. We still managed to take 1st at District Finals when Caedy nailed the last question to win the game.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The quizmaster (at Regionals) misread a question, (completely botched it up) but didn't call the misread (but we still love her ;-). The other team interrupted and answered correctly. When our team called "Contest" the quizmaster immediately said, "Contest accepted."
* **Favorite quiz question**\

* **Team History**\
Jonathan and Makena quizzed at Regionals last year where we lost three play-off rounds and obviously didn't make it to Nationals. Both quizzers were not nearly as well prepared last year and have worked hard to make it happen this year. We did wind up tied for 6th this year but won the play-off with Lexington #1 (I think they were actually the #2 Lexington team). While I didn't expect to make it to Nationals, my quizzers really wanted to and worked very hard to be in the position to recieve a wild card. We are really pleased and excited for the opportunity to go. We had a very good year this year in League quizzing. We took first in our league but at District Finals, Lafayette, Indiana (our chief rival) played great at Districts and won first. We were actually given a wildcard to Regionals as we were the 4th place team in Indiana. We lost at Regionals to the 5th place team from Indiana who also recieved a wildcard but we beat Lafayette, Lakeview and Munster (they all beat us at District) to move ahead of them at the Great Lakes Region. We went to two Invitationals this year but were only about 50/50 in the win column. We did win a few big matches this year though. At the Gobblefest, we beat Sarver (usually they mop the floor with us) but we won on the last question. At the Great Lakes Region we beat Lexington's teams for the first time in some time. We won on the last question against their top team and edged their second team both in the round robin and in a playoff. We have not beaten Lexington very many times over the years so that was exciting as they are a team we look up to and like a lot.\
\
This team is one of the most fun I have ever coached. All year long I have basically asked them to just "learn the material". Makena would ask, "Do you think we can make it to Nationals?" I would just say do the work and any thing is possible. I didn't want to pressure them into working for "Nationals" so I just kept telling them that if they worked hard anything could happen. I think I missed more practices this year than these quizzers did combined. They always came excited and motivated. Not always ready but mostly they came prepared. It is great to see them make it to Nationals because I wasn't driving them to do it. I just wanted them to learn the material and see what happens. I don't think I can point to any one verse that these kids like. There are chapters they don't like as well as others but I think that is because they are still a weakness for them.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
The most exciting match of the year had to be against Lexington. I hope when or if they read this they don't take offense but we really have not done well against them and it was great to get a win. It could be that Lexington wasn't up on their game that round as that happens sometimes too but you take what you can in this type of situation. The fact that it went down to the last question showed me that my team was interrupting well and competing which was real important for us.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
On the first question of the play-off for sixth place at Great Lakes: My number three quizzer had a great hit on a ten point question. I don't even remember the question but she finished it and answered and they counted her wrong. After the re-read she was doing her confer and I was thinking that I am going to have to initiate a contest but as soon as time was called she called for the contest and we were both thinking the same thing. We presented the contest (Kenadee wouldn't do it so I had to) and we got it.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
Only one verse contains dashes. Give this verse.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Gobblefest]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/gobblefest.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
There are just to many good times with this team to pick one out. I really like working with them and they are very easy to coach.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
I know that all of my quizzers are Christians and we have talked about our lives as Christians and how we live in the world but I can't point to any one instance to bring up right now. I appreciate these kids and their witness. I also have to say that I have the best parents in the world as they have been and are still a tremendous support to me.

* **Team History**\
Lexington has sent twelve teams to nationals since 1996. They were also the national champions in 1997. Our team has enjoyed several aspects of Nationals. Playing games in the hallways with other teams. Competition at this level. Touring the different parts of the country. Car rides. But of all the times I've attended two as a coach, two times have stood out. The first being the time we were robbed and everything was stolen from our van. The Bible Quiz Ministry took an offering for our two teams and blessed us with more than enough to buy all that was needed for this trip and the mission trip we were heading to the day after Nationals. We had money left over and we used that to purchase baskets to give to everyone at Nationals when it came to Lexington. We felt so loved during a stressful time. The second time that stood out was the cruise in Seattle. Seeing quizzers enjoy the sunset, some worshiping -some talking, some playing cards.... it was a taste of heaven.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had different combination's of kids every time, but overtime matches are always exciting. We had several all year.
* **Favorite contest**\
My quizzers' favorite contest is when they get to contest on behalf of the other team when an official ruled the other team wrong and we can help defend their answer.
* **Favorite Question**\
A mile long question asking which chapters shared section titles.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * 1 Cor 12:18
  * 1 Cor 16:14
  * 2 Cor 3:17
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})

  * Atlanta Open
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
This can be something that happened in a church van, in a hotel room, etc.- Our team stayed at a lake house at Regionals it was such a blessing.Other answers from various quizzers: listening to Geddy and Billy quoting in princess voices, hanging with quizzers at Panera, speed boat last year on the Dells, Stone Mountain.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\

* **Team History**\
Prior to this year, James River has sent thirteen teams to nationals since 2001, with five of them placing in the top three. This is the first national finals for these quizzers.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
At Regionals we played in the championship playoff round against our other James River team. We played extremely well, and won the game, securing the Regional title. For a group of quizzers who have never quizzed at Nationals before, this was very exciting.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
We had a very long and drawn out contest against Ash Grove at Districts involving grammar, verbs, and subordinate clauses. Joshua Havens matched Karl in the confusing argument department, and sadly, our contest was denied. We were able to laugh about it quite a lot. Also, at Regionals, Karl was on prescription painkillers and was attempting to give a rebuttal about what the opposing quizzer from Central said. Karl actually said, "I'm pretty high right now, but I'm pretty sure he said..." The best part was that Darin Poe, the So. MO DYD was watching the game. The second best part was that we won the contest.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
From Joey Bohanon's practice questions:\
The motion pictures Star Trek II and Star Trek III explore which is better: the good of the one, or the good of the many. According to Paul, which was more important?
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
2 Corinthians 12:9: "But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me."

* **Team History**\
Central has competed at more national finals than any other team. Their first appearance was in 1976 when only eight teams went to nationals. They were the first team to appear at nationals for an entire cycle, from 1986 to 1993. They also went in 1995, sent two teams in 1996, went in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001 and every year since 2008. Former team members include two top scorers, Jhan Hurst and Marcae Johnson, as well as Karl Dawson and website administrator Joey Bohanon. Central placed third in 1976, 1987, 1996 and 2000 and second in 1988 and 1997.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
We had a match early this season against Christian Temple from Houston, TX at the Gold Cup tournament in Dallas. We had made several mistakes early, and subsequently we need the last 5 questions for a double-quizout to win. We were able to get the win and were very excited.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
I believe it involved a Hindrance contest at the Houston tournament against Briargate. There was something about a floor-waxing machine that looks like a Zamboni. Briargate contested the hindrance and didn't get it.
* **Favorite quiz question (weirdest, funniest, etc)**\
Application Question-What do Christians smell like?
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * Brianna: 1C 15:57
  * Emily: 2C 11:12
  * Matthew: 1C 1:8
  * Daniel: 2C 11:33

* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
We ran into a median after the Houston tournament on our way to go bowling. No one was hurt, but we did have to report the accident to our church as we were in a church vehicle.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
Many of the kids have used their Scriptural knowledge to support their faith when engaged in conversation with friends, family, or acquaintances. One particular example occurred when Matthew was quoting at the public library and was able to share the gospel with a library worker who later committed their life to the Lord.

* **Most exciting match this season**\
At districts we played JR "Perfect in Weakness" and we were winning but it was still close at the 19th question and we discovered that there was a buzzer that wasn't working. So we had to replay up to question 16, but we ended up winning this hard fought match.

* **Team History**\
Our team is advancing to Nationals for the 3rd time. In 2007 we went as a one-man team (Jonathan Plank) to Tucson and won 8 rounds (Corydon, IA). In 2008, we went as a two man team to Green Bay and ranked 2nd to last (Chariton, IA). This year we are finally bringing a full team to Nationals in Deeeeetroit.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Our most exciting match was against Moberly, Missouri (coached by my former coach, Randy Lee) at the 2010 NC Regionals. We were 8 and 1 and trying to hang on to our 1st place ranking. On question 10 we used our last timeout and were down 85 to (-15). We ended up winning the match 120 to 70 on the last question. And yes, our teams are still on speaking terms. We went to lunch together that same day.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The question was: give the verse that mentions a haircut. The other team quoted a verse that mentions a head being shaved. We had to convince the judges that a haircut was something altogether different than a hair "shave."
* **Favorite question**\
Give the 19 questions in 1 Corinthians 9.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\

  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Jonathan quoted 1 Corinthians 15 during a Sunday evening service at Berean (approximately 200 in attendance). He quoted slow and articulate until he got to the last section, at which point he put his quoting into overdrive and therefore mostly unintelligible. He got a standing "O."
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
My wife and use Bible quiz as a ministry tool to teach and train the kids we have adopted over the years, many of whom have come from a non-church background. (ie. our 14 year old daugher Anna Plank memorized 1 Corinthians this year. We adopted her last July.)

* **Team History**\
This will be Racine's fourth time attending Nationals. We also attended in 1997, 1998, and 2009.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
There are two matches that stick out as the most exciting. One was against Portage, WI at district finals. Between both teams all 20 questions were answered correctly (nobody got any wrong). The other match was against Cedar Rapids, IA at Regionals. The match came down to the last question. The team that got the last question would win. Cedar Rapids got the question and it was ruled correct. Our team contested and it was accepted. Then the other team contested and it was denied. We got a re-read and won the match.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
The team's favorite contest was the one in the match against Cedar Rapids, IA (mentioned as one of the most exciting matches). We needed to get the last question, which was a 20 pointer, to win. After Cedar Rapids got it correct, Ross called sort of a desperation contest because the quizzer added a few words to his answer that may have been incorrect. The coach agreed to contest the answer and the contest was accepted!
* **Favorite question**\
At the Mid-Winter Classic, Tyler Turnage was the question writer (he also happens to be a die-hard Vikings fan). For the first 4 matches, the 4th question of the match was a question about Brett Farve.\
\
One of Nathan's favorite questions from Regionals was Give in essence the verses that say Paul preached the gospel, quote, free of charge' because it was on the list of concordance material that he had studied.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * Ross: 1 Corinthians 15:1
  * Nathan: 1 Corinthans 15:57 or 1 Corinthians 1:3-4
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Michiana]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/michiana.md %})
  * [Mid-Winter Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/mid-winter-classic.md %})
  * [River Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/river-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
After the River Classic going to eat at Lamberts and roller skating. Also, everyone playing Mario Kart together in the church van when we travel to tournaments.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
For Nathan there have been situations which have come up where scriptures he has studied currently or in the past, comes to mind to assist him with that situation. Sometimes it could be a personal situation or a class topic. It is also neat for him to see that events he is involved in this year have integrated some of the Corinthian scriptures (the Fine Arts theme came from 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Royal Rangers from 2 Corinthians 10:4).

* **Team History**\
This will be the third time the Swordmasters (aka "Bringers of Cookies") have been to National finals. A highlight being that they went undefeated at Regionals in '09.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
A match that sticks in our memory, would be at Regionals: A quizzer on the other team had blundered on kind of an obvious question, so when conferring, he lamented by calling himself a doofus. His brother reassuringly said "You're not a-- well, you are a doofus, but it's okay."
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
Our contesting skills could use work, but we've been mastering the art of the rebuttal. Our favorites have become, "You shouldn't give this to them, because they're evil!" and "They're just jealous of our hair."
* **Favorite question**\
Favorite question this year would be at Regionals where the quizzer had to quote the verse that mentioned a hair cut.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
By far, our favorite team verse would be 2nd Corinthians 12:1a. "I must go on boasting."
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Berean Family Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/berean-family-classic.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
On the way back from Regionals we were playing the alphabet game, (sort of like Johnny's Pocket or Going to Grandma's House). Luke, who had scorekept for us and is basically a walking encyclopedia, put in the dinosaur named Dodoricus. After many questions about it, he sounded it out for us mortals as "DO-DOR-I-CUS." Of course, who could resist over-pronouncing this every time it came up in the game? Luke bore it fairly patiently, even when he later had to admit that he had goofed and the actual word was Doedicurus. We love you, Luke.
* **What opportunities has your team had to use Bible Quiz outside of the church?**\
All the practical times we've found to quote 2nd Corinthians 12:1a.

During the quote-a-thon, when the quizzers ask for sponsors, they often quote some of the scripture to the people who are considering becoming sponsors. They've quoted to friends, family, and even their dentists! Isaac and LaJoie quoted to their grandmother when she was seriously ill and in a nursing home for rehab.

* **Team History**\
The ministry at Word of Life was started in 2007 with a vision to "hide" God's Word in the hearts of our youth and to provide spiritual mentoring for both our middle and high school youth. It was a natural extension from JBQ which we started in 2006. We really want to see the next generation assume the spiritual "mantle" and have a double blessing and anointing in fulfilling the Great Commission. In our first year (GEPCP), we learned very early on that we were in over our heads. Although we were coached by a former and successful Penn-Del quizzer Beth Reynolds, it was our first year and it would be a while before our youth learned the rules and mechanics of the competition. During that same year we were joined by Don York and Sam York from Cornerstone A/G in Bowie, Md, which added a Nationals-level Coach and another strong quizzer to our team. We made it to Regionals in our first year but we lost handily to the more experienced teams at Regionals. In our second year (Mark) we made it to Regionals and finished 6th -- after a playoff match to determine the 5th place for Nationals. This, our 3rd year (1/2 Corinthians), we finished a strong 4th and qualified for Nationals for the very first time in Word of Life history. Praise to His Name!!!
* **Most exciting match this season**\
This year at Regionals we lost a round on the last question, which if we had gotten it, we would have placed 2nd instead of 4th.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**\
There are so many favorites but here's one: 1 Corinthians 13:13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
* **Tournaments attended this year**:
  * [Empire Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/empire-classic.md %})

  * [Friendship Classic]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/friendship-classic.md %})
  * [Three Rivers]({% link _pages/history/2010/tournaments/three-rivers.md %})
* **Favorite non-quiz related moment this year**\
Returning from Friendship, we almost ran out of gas in the mountains of Pennsylvania. A check of the nearest gas station on our GPS indicated about 12 miles to go. We really prayed and we made it with just enough gas to spare!!!

* **Team History**\
This is Swedesboro's second year attending nationals. They finished sixth in the challenger division last year.
* **Most exciting match this season**\
Kaitlyn, Kayla and Miranda's favorite/most exciting match was the playoff round at regionals this year.
* **Favorite contest (weirdest, most clever, etc)**\
A quizzer on the other team was answering a quote and said "cupper" instead of supper. The officials (who were laughing) originally ruled correct. I was about to take a 5pt foul and call contest and all 3 of my quizzers at table yelled contest. The whole time Kayla was giving the contest the rest of us were hysterical. The other team tried arguing the new quotation rule, but even 1 or more teammates turned and said, "You said cupper!" We have no idea why they ruled correct, but we won the contest.
* **Favorite quiz question**\
Only one verse contains dashes. Give this verse.
* **Favorite verse from Corinthians**
  * Kaitlyn: 2 Cor 9:8
  * Kayla: 2 Cor 4:15-18
  * Miranda: 2 Cor 4:17-18
