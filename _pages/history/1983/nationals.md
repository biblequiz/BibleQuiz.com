The 21st National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 8-10, 1983 in Anaheim, California covering the book of Acts. Ted Brust was the National Coordinator and Brenton Osgood was the official question writer.

The event was won by First A/G, New Orleans, LA (pictured), the same church which won Nationals in 1971. The second place team was Byesville A/G, Byesville, OH.

The team from First A/G, New Orleans, LA became the third church to win Nationals more than once as they joined Full Gospel Chapel, Denver, CO (1966,1967) and Evangel Temple, A/G, Decatur, GA (1963,1976,1978) as multiple winners. New Orleans became the first team to average over 200 points at Nationals with a 207.86 per quiz average besting the record set the previous year by Evangel Temple, A/G, Decatur, GA. New Orleans still had to overcome the team from Byesville, OH in a playoff to claim the first place trophy.

1983 marked the first time that quizzers who had graduated from high school but were still 19 by the beginning of the quiz year could not participate. This caused quite a turnover in quizzing personnel from the previous year. It also marked the final year of the eight team National Finals tournament as the next year participants who finished second in each region were allowed to participate with the eight regional champions.

The top quizzer at the 1983 National Finals was John Wooton of Byesville A/G, Byesville, OH. In becoming the top scorer, John established a record for average points with 113.67 per quiz. This would become the first of 2 consecutive top scorer honors for John.
