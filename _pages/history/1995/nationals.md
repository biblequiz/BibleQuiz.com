The 33rd National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 7-10, 1995 in St. Louis, Missouri at the Regal Riverfront Hotel covering the gospel of John. Rich Percifield was the National Coordinator and Mike Batty was the official question writer.

This was the last year in which the third-place tournament was held on Monday. The eight third-place teams from each region were invited to participate in a tournament among themselves on Monday. The top four teams were allowed to compete for the championship with the other 16 teams. Several third-place teams declined to participate, and some that did participate only got to quiz on Monday.

This was also the first National Finals following the switch from the King James Version to the New International Version.

The national championship was won in a playoff by Allison Park A/G, Allison Park, PA. The second-place team, Grace A/G, Syracuse, NY would go on to win the 1996 national championship. The third-place team was 1994 national champions St. Clair Shores A/G, St. Clair Shores, MI.

This was the only the second national championship for the Northeast region. The only other championship for the Northeast region was Ebony Assembly of God, Ebony, VA in 1973. This was also the first of two consecutive years for a Northeast sweep of the top two spots which further illustrates the region's dominance in this year. Sarver, PA, the other team from the Northeast, finished fifth.
