More than 34 teams from seven different states were in attendance for the two-day event, which boasted a two-bracket 80-quizzer one-on-one tournament,
and an eight-round team placement tournament, followed by a four-flight sudden-death team championship.

## Championship Flight

### Teams

*Wins and Losses from the opening 8 rounds determine places in playoff, and then single-elimination determines the winners from there, so wins and losses don't always match up.*
