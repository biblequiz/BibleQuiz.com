## A Division

Mountain Home Assembly (Mountain Home, ID) began defense of their Mile High Classic title with a strong 4-0 start Saturday morning with the consistent quizzing of Marla and Chandra
Porter. Their first afternoon match was with Meridian Assembly (Meridian, ID) who was unbeaten at 3   0. In a closely contested match, Jon Pon quizzed out on the final question to
earn Meridian a hard fought 5-point win. This win set up a showdown with Calvary Temple (Auburn, WA), who had lost their first match of the day to Mountain Home Assembly.
Calvary Temple took charge early in the match with Steve Patient leading the way to a win, necessitating another match with Meridian Assembly to play off the first place tie. After
falling behind early, Calvary Temple came on strong to win with Steve, Aaron Fell and Ross Rogers making solid contributions.
