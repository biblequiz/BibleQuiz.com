After dominating the regular season, Ocala is surprised by a gritty, gutty Fort Myers team. Fort Myers becomes District champion
for the 5th straight year, equaling the record set by Lakeland's Carpenter's Home Church. However, a bigger surprise was the
strong play of Vero Beach, an Entry Level team that beat the 'big boys' to qualify for Regionals.
