The 40th National Bible Quiz Finals took place July 7-12, 2002 in Bothell, WA at Cedar Park Assembly of God covering the epistles 1 and 2 Corinthians. Bernie Elliot was the National Coordinator and Greg House, Rick Faulkner, Kent Piacenti and Tim Bahra were the official question writers. This was the third year in which the official writing team wrote questions. In years prior to 2000, one writer would write league questions and the league writer from the previous year wrote the district, regional and national questions. This year was the second year of an experiment to see if having a fixed team of writers for both leagues and official competition would work. Though some members left the team and others joined, they continued to write officially until 2004.

This was also the third year in which 40 teams were invited to participate. On the first day, the second through fifth place teams from each region competed in four separate divisions. The top three in each division joined the eight regional champions in the championship division. The other twenty teams played each other in the challenger division.

The championship division was won by Orange Hills Assembly of God, Orange, CA (pictured). The second place team was Living Waters Chapel, Lebanon, PA. The third place team was Braeswood Assembly of God, Houston, TX . The challenger division was won by Cedar Park A/G "So-called Angels", Bothell, WA.

This marks the fourth consecutive and fourteenth overall year in which the Southwest region has won nationals. This was also the second of three national championships for Orange Hills. They also won in 1999 and 2003. As in 1999 and 2003, this team was undefeated, a feat accomplished by only one other team since expansion (Owasso, OK in 2008). Coach Mel Aou was also involved with the 1993 and 1999 championship teams. Ricky Haney and David Dorey were on the 1999 championship team and Peter Brown and David Dorey were on the 2003 championship team. Dorey was also on the championship team in 2004.

The individual tournament was won by Caleb Booth of Tulsa, OK . The quoting bee was won by Angela Goodman of King's Chapel, Springfield, MO . The west won their fourth consecutive east-west quiz.
