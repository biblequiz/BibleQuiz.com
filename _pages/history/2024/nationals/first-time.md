Welcome to National Finals! We're glad to have you celebrate a full week of studying and competing on God's Word in Dallas, TX.

First, we highly recommend reading over the [Frequently Asked Questions]({% link _pages/history/2024/nationals/faq.md %}).

We'll be adding more content for first-year National competitors in the coming weeks.

If you have any questions, reach out to the National TBQ Coordinator—Pastor Bernie Elliot—at [pastorbernie@biblequiz.com](mailto:pastorbernie@biblequiz.com).

Here's a quick view of what the worship, quizzing, and fellowship moments looked like at National Finals last year.
