The 30th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 3-7, 1992 in Fort Worth, TX at the Worthington Hotel covering the epistles of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. Rich Percifield was the National Coordinator and Bob Roller was the official question writer.

This was the last year in which only two teams from each region were invited to participate, however, a team from Hawaii was allowed to participate in spite of not finishing in the top two at the Southwest regional finals.

The national championship was won by Parkcrest A/G, Springfield, MO. The second place team was First A/G, Bartlesville, OK. Bartlesville also finished second in 1993. The third place team was Radiant A/G, Colorado Springs, CO. The Radiant team was the modern-day Briargate team which won national championships in 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2007.

This marked the sixth overall year in which the Gulf region has won nationals.

The top scorer at the 1992 National Finals was Josh Weber of Lakeland, FL. Josh was also a member of the 1990 and 1991 championship teams.
