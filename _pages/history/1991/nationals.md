The 29th National Bible Quiz Finals took place August 6-10, 1991 in Portland, Oregon at the Oregon Convention Center covering the book of Acts. Rich Percifield was the National Coordinator and Glen Percifield was the official question writer.

The event was won by Carpenter's Home Church, Lakeland, FL (pictured) for the second consecutive year. The second place team was Calvary Christian Center, Buena Park, CA who won in a playoff.

In claiming their second consecutive National Finals victory, the team from Carpenter's Home Church, Lakeland, FL became the fourth team to accomplish this feat. The others were Full Gospel Chapel, Denver, CO in 1966-67, First A/G, New Orleans, LA in 1983-84, and First A/G, Tempe, AZ in 1986-87. Calvary Christian Center, Buena Park, CA, who had won second place at the 1989 National Finals, claimed the second place trophy by defeating Christian Life Church, Farmington, MN in a playoff.

The 1991 field contained three past and two future National Champions. In addition to Lakeland, the past champions included Renton A/G, Renton, WA in 1981 and Evangel Community Church, Centerville, GA in 1963,1976 and 1978 (the church had changed names and locations over the years from Bouldercrest to Decatur to Centerville). The future champions included Parkcrest A/G, Springfield, MO in 1992, and Allison Park A/G, Allison Park, PA in 1995. It should also be noted that members of the team from Buena Park would win Nationals in 1993 as Life Center A/G, Lakewood, CA. The Southeast region was perhaps the toughest this year as Evangel Community Church, Centerville, GA finished fourth in addition to Lakeland's victory.
