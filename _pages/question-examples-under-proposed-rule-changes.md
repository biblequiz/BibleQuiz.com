To help quizzers, coaches, officials, and question writers understand the latest changes, we have compiled many of the common questions with answers from multiple verses to show the differences. The following examples will feature two questions in a before/after format.

## Multiple part question

Here's a before-and-after for a multiple-part question from the same chapter.

> **20 points. 2-part reference question. From First Peter chapter 1.**  
**What** will be revealed, and **who** will be revealed?  
\[1P 1:5\]      the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.  
\[1P 1:13\]    Jesus Christ 

> **20 points. 2-part question. From separate verses of First Peter chapter 1.**  
**What** will be revealed, and **who** will be revealed?

---

If the introductory remarks specify multiple chapters, you may not hear "From separate verses" because the introductory remarks already specify the answer comes from different chapters (see Bible Quiz Rules, page 25, Separate Verses 1.a.).

✅ Required to state if the answer will come from consecutive/separate verses\*

## Give a complete answer

- If the answer comes from consecutive verses, the introductory remark will state "From \_\_\_ consecutive verses..."
- If the answer comes from separate verses, the introductory remark will state "From \_\_\_ separate verses..."
- For Give a complete answer, the introductory remarks will **always** tell you how many verses the answer will come from.

#### From consecutive verses

\[H 9:22\]    In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

According to Hebrew 7:5 and 9:22, the law requires what?

✅ Required to state if the answer will come from consecutive/separate verses  
✅ Required to state how many verses the answer comes from

## Quotation/Essence Completion Questions

Because completion questions require a quizzer to finish a verse, statement, or some other item, the necessity to specify consecutive verses in the introductory remarks is not critical. Thus, it's not required.

However, using "From consecutive verses..." is still optional if a question writer wants to use it.

Both of the following ways to ask this question are acceptable.

> **30 points. Quotation completion question. From 1 Peter chapter 1.**  
Finish this verse and the one which follows, quote, "This letter is from Peter… "

> **30 points. Quotation completion question. From consecutive verses of 1 Peter chapter 1.**  
Finish this verse and the one which follows, quote, "This letter is from Peter… "

⚠️ Not required to state if the answer will come from consecutive verses, but optional

## Quotation/Essence Questions

If the question asks for consecutive verses by reference in the question itself, it must not be labeled a multiple part question and must say "from \_\_\_ consecutive verses."

#### Requiring consecutive verses from the same chapter

When asking for consecutive verses by the verse number, questions are required to be asked like this when the chapter is in the question.

> **30 points. Quotation question. From 1 Peter.**

> **30 points. Quotation question. From 3 consecutive verses of 1 Peter.**

#### Summary

✅ Required to state if the answer will come from consecutive/separate verses\*

#### ⚠️ Exception

In the case where an individual or geographical location is named multiple times, unless all of the occurrences of the required answers are consecutive, it must be labeled "From separate verses."

> Suppose Jesus is named in verses 31 and 35, and Peter is named in verse 32.  
In theory, the question writer could demand verses 31 and 32 **_or_** verses 32 and 35, both with the same answer of "Peter, Jesus."  
This is required to be labeled "From separate verses."

## Questions that require multiple answers from multiple verses (not Chapter Analysis, GCA, QQ/EQ, or QCQ/ECQ)

This works in the same way it does under the existing rules, with the addition of "From separate verses" or "From consecutive verses."

> **20 points. 2-part scripture text question. 5-part answer.**  
What and whom are described as being, quote, "of Christ"?

> **20 points. 3-Part answer. From separate verses of Hebrews.**  
Who were persecuted?

#### ⚠️ Exception

In the case where an answer appears multiple times in a chapter, unless all of the occurrences of the required answers are consecutive, it must be labeled "From separate verses."

> Suppose a question asks how the author completes the phrase "of God." In the chapter, "will of God" appears in verses 17 and 22, and "kingdom of God" appears in verse 18. In theory, the question writer could demand verses 17 and 18 **_or_** verses 18 and 22, both with the same answer of "will, kingdom." This is required to be labeled "From separate verses."

#### Summary

✅ Required to state if the answer will come from consecutive/separate verses\*  

## Questions that require books, chapters, or references

Because the question is asking for a *location* and not the content of book, chapter, or verse itself, the introductory remarks cannot state "From consecutive/separate verses."

The introductory remarks remain unchanged.

> **30 points. 18-part answer.**    
Jesus is named in which chapters?

This question remains the same.
