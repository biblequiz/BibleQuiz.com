To help quizzers, coaches, officials, and question writers understand the latest changes, we have compiled many of the common questions with answers from multiple verses to show the differences. The following examples will feature two questions in a before/after format.

## Multiple part question

Here's a before-and-after for a multiple-part question from the same chapter.

> **20 points. 2-part reference question. From First Peter chapter 1.**  
**What** will be revealed, and **who** will be revealed?  
\[1P 1:5\]      the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.  
\[1P 1:13\]    Jesus Christ 

> **20 points. 2-part question. From separate verses of First Peter chapter 1.**  
**What** will be revealed, and **who** will be revealed?

---

If the introductory remarks specify multiple chapters, you may not hear "From separate verses" because the introductory remarks already specify the answer comes from different chapters (see Bible Quiz Rules, page 25, Separate Verses 1.a.).

✅ Required to state if the answer will come from consecutive/separate verses\*

## Give a complete answer

- If the answer comes from consecutive verses, the introductory remark will **always** state "From \_\_\_ consecutive verses..."
- If the answer comes from separate verses, the introductory remark will **always** state "From \_\_\_ separate verses..."
- For Give a complete answer, the introductory remarks will **always** tell you how many verses the answer will come from.

✅ Required to state if the answer will come from consecutive/separate verses

## Quotation/Essence Completion Questions

Because completion questions require a quizzer to finish a verse, statement, or some other item, the necessity to specify consecutive verses in the introductory remarks is not critical. Thus, it's not required.

However, using "From consecutive verses..." is still optional if a question writer wants to use it.

Both of the following ways to ask this question are acceptable.

> **30 points. Quotation completion question. From 1 Peter chapter 1.**  
Finish this verse and the one which follows, quote, "This letter is from Peter… "

> **30 points. Quotation completion question. From consecutive verses of 1 Peter chapter 1.**  
Finish this verse and the one which follows, quote, "This letter is from Peter… "

⚠️ Not required to state if the answer will come from consecutive verses, but optional

### ⚠️ Exception

In the case where an individual or geographical location is named multiple times, unless all of the occurrences of the required answers are consecutive, it must be labeled "From separate verses."

> Suppose Jesus is named in verses 31 and 35, and Peter is named in verse 32.  
In theory, the question writer could demand verses 31 and 32 **_or_** verses 32 and 35, both with the same answer of "Peter, Jesus."  
This is required to be labeled "From separate verses."

## Multiple answers from multiple verses (not Chapter Analysis, GCA, QQ/EQ, or QCQ/ECQ)

> In theory, the question writer could demand verses 17 and 18 **_or_** verses 18 and 22, both with the same answer of "will, kingdom."  
> This is required to be labeled "From separate verses."

## Requiring books, chapters, or references

Because the question is asking for a *location* and not the content of book, chapter, or verse itself, the introductory remarks cannot state "From consecutive/separate verses."

The introductory remarks remain unchanged.

> **30 points. 18-part answer.**    
Jesus is named in which chapters?

This question remains the same.
