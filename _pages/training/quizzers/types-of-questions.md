This question has many answers, depending on who is writing the questions and what the level of competition is. Let's look at First Corinthians 1:1.

> Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes

There are many questions that could be asked from this verse. The simplest on would ask you to quote the verse. There are also many ways to ask this. For instance:

Quote verse one from the opening chapter. Quote Mark 1:1. Quote the opening verse of Mark. Quote the verse in which Sosthenes is named. Quote the verse which names Sosthenes.

...and so on. You might notice that some of these questions are very similar, but have different wording. Typically writers make it possible for quizzers to interrupt the question. On the first question, you can finish the question from "opening". On the second and third questions, you can't hit until the last word. On the fourth question, you can hit on "Sosthenes". On the fifth question, you can't hit until the last word. We'll talk more later about interrupting. Beyond quotes, there are analysis questions. For instance:

> Mark 1:1 names which individuals?

These questions are always very popular. This is why you should learn the material by reference. Beyond these, there are "general knowledge" questions. For instance:

Who was called to be an apostle? Paul was an apostle of whom? Paul was an apostle of whom, by what? Who wrote First Corinthians? By whose will was Paul and apostle? Who is our brother?

There are others that can be written and you should try to write them yourself. See how many questions you can write for 1 Corinthians 1:2. The more questions you hear in practice, the better you will be at writing your own questions.

There are many more types of questions that are more advanced and you may eventually want to start learning.
