This year at National Finals, we are organizing all communication using an app called [Discord](http://discord.com).

Discord is 100% free to use on computers, phones, and tablets, and there is no advertising.

Here are just a few of the things we will be using Discord for:

-   General announcements, like last-minute room changes
-   Quoting bee and individual tournament room assignments
-   Scheduling officials each day
-   Finding rides to the airport or to a restaurant
-   Finding teammates for Adult Bible Quiz

Best of all, you will have **complete control** over what notifications you get!

Here's how you can join the Bible Quiz Nationals Discord server.

## Create a Discord account

Like everything these days, you'll need an account. Here's a link to walk you through the process of setting up a free Discord account.

## Join the server

Once you have your account setup, request a link to join from the [Facebook group](https://facebook.com/groups/agbiblequiz).

## Manage notifications

Discord lets you control your notifications, so you only get the notifications you want.

On desktop, click on a channel, and look for the bell icon at the top right

Click on the bell, and you will have an option to Mute the channel (which will stop notifications).

You can also hit "All Messages" to make sure you don't miss anything!

On mobile, press and hold the channel you want to adjust. A menu will pop up from the bottom. Tap "Notification Settings."

Tap the first option to select your mute settings, or All Messages to get all notifications from a channel.
