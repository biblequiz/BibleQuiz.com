# Upgrading from Older Versions

EZScore and ScoreKeep were originally developed by Larry Mullins over 20 years ago when he recognized how difficult and error-prone it was to keep score by hand on a paper score sheet. Over that time, there have been multiple different versions of the application. These older versions are no longer supported and should be uninstalled from your machine.

If you have one of the following apps installed, it is **STRONGLY** recommended to uninstall them and upgrade to the latest versions shown above:

| Icon                                                                                                    | Name                      | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![EZScore (Beta)]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/icon-ezscore-beta.png %})                  | EZScore (Beta)            | Latest EZScore rewrite forming the foundation for the current Windows EZScore.          |
| ![ScoreKeep Uploader (Beta)]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/icon-scorekeep-uploader.png %}) | ScoreKeep Uploader (Beta) | Uploader of legacy ScoreKeep databases to Registration Site for the EZScore (Beta) app. |
| ![EZScore]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/icon-ezscore.png %})                              | EZScore                   | Last version before EZScore (Beta).                                                     |
| ![ScoreKeep]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/icon-scorekeep.png %})                          | ScoreKeep                 | Last version before ScoreKeep Uploader (Beta).                                          |

If you have any of these applications installed, uninstalling is easy. The following example shows how to uninstall `EZScore (Beta)`:
1. Open Start Menu and type `EZScore (Beta)`. If the app isn't found, it isn't installed on your machine.\
![]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/uninstall-start-menu.png %})
2. Click the `Uninstall` button.
3. Find `EZScore (Beta)` in the list.\
![]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/uninstall-control-panel.png %})
4. Click `Uninstall/Change`.
5. Select `Remove the application from this computer.`\
![]({% link assets/images/old-app-instructions/uninstall-confirmation.png %})
6. Click `OK`.
7. Repeat these steps for each of the legacy apps.
