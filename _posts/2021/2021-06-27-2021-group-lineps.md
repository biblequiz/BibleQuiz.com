ST. LOUIS, MO — The field of 39 teams is set for the 2021 Assemblies of God Teen Bible Quiz National Finals Tournament, being held June 28 through July 1 at the Renaissance Airport Hotel in S. Louis, Missouri.

This year’s tournament, coming on the heels of the cancellation of the 2020 edition because of the COVID-19 pandemic, begins Monday morning with the preliminary group stage — four groups of eight teams each and a fifth group of seven who will play a round robin schedule. The top 20 teams will then advance to the Championship Division of the main tournament stage, from which the national champion team will emerge after 19 round robin games.
