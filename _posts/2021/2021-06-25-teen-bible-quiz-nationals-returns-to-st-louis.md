The Assemblies of God Teen Bible Quiz National Finals returns to the Renaissance St. Louis Airport Hotel for 2021, the second time the facility has hosted the national championship tournament and the fourth Finals in metro St. Louis.

But more importantly to TBQ fans, it marks a return to normal, after the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and much of the following regular season was curtailed, with several districts not holding league competition at all and others resorting to quizzing online via Zoom.

Tournament events get under way on Saturday, June 26 with registration and the traditional ice cream social. Sunday's events include the Quoting Bee and the Senior Shoot-Out. The team competition begins Monday morning at 9:45 a.m. Central Time, with seven rounds of play in each of the five preliminary groups. On Tuesday, the main round-robin draw begins, with 19 rounds all day Tuesday and Wednesday plus rounds 18 and 19 on Thursday morning.

The individual Tournament takes place on Thursday after the end of team play, followed by the Adult Team Tournament. The week concludes with the Awards Banquet on Friday night.

Results and tournament news will be posted here at Biblequiz.com throughout the week.
