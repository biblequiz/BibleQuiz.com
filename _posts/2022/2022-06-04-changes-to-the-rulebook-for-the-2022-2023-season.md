The rulebook for next season has been posted!

We have created a dedicated section on the site to both download the rulebook and find out more information about the changes.

<a href="{% link _pages/changes-to-the-rulebook-for-the-2022-2023-season.md %}" class="button is-primary">Changes to the Rulebook for the 2022-2023 Season&nbsp;<i
    class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></a>

>NOTE: This rulebook is for _next_ season and will NOT be used at Nationals Finals in Palm Springs in just a few weeks. You can download the current rulebook [here]({% link assets/2021/21-22-Bible-Quiz-Rules.pdf %}).
