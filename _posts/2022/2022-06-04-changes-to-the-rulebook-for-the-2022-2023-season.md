The rulebook for next season has been posted!

We have created a dedicated section on the site to both download the rulebook and find out more information about the changes.

NOTE: This rulebook is for _next_ season and will NOT be used at Nationals Finals in Palm Springs in just a few weeks. You can download the current rulebook [here](https://www.biblequiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/21-22-Bible-Quiz-Rules.pdf).
