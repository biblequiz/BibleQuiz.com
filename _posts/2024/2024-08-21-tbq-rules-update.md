### Summary of changes

Team fouls are no longer assessed after a third unsuccessful contest. (Teams are still restricted from contesting after a third unsuccessful contest.)

Also, there is now a clear definition for when a question is considered interrupted, specifically at the first sound of the first word. (See page 8 for more information).

Lastly, minor adjustments, clarifications, and grammatical tweaks have been made for better understanding and accuracy.
