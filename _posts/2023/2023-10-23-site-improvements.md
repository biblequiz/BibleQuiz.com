BibleQuiz.com has received a series of changes to better help coaches and coordinators prepare their teams for competition.

## JBQ Content
Junior Bible Quiz (JBQ) registration has been active for several years on BibleQuiz.com, and now we have added upcoming event information, live stats, and JBQ Nationals history ([going back to 2009](https://biblequiz.com/jbq/2009/nationals/)).

To help JBQ teams navigate the site, we have added a dedicated section in the main navigation to gather all of the JBQ content together. 

And we plan to add more JBQ information in the future!

## Upcoming Events
For events that have been added to the [BibleQuiz.com registration site](https://registration.biblequiz.com), it's never been easier to find the stats and schedule for the event. Visit the Upcoming and Live Event page for [JBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com/upcoming-events/jbq/) and [TBQ](https://www.biblequiz.com/upcoming-events/tbq/).

## Quizzer Search
Ever wanted to see *all* the stats from a quizzer's career in both JBQ and TBQ? 

Thanks to the new Quizzer Search, it's easy to search for *any* quizzer on BibleQuiz.com and see their JBQ and/or TBQ results!

Go to the [Quizzer Search page](https://biblequiz.com/quizzers/) (available from the History page of either [JBQ](https://biblequiz.com/jbq/) or [TBQ](https://biblequiz.com/history/)). In the search bar at the top, type in the quizzer's name and hit Search. 

You'll see a list of all history pages they're named in.

This feature is still in beta and may have some issues with typos or multiple quizzers with the same name. If you spot an error, email [hello@biblequiz.com](mailto:hello@biblequiz.com).

## TBQ History
60 years of Bible Quiz history has been restored to BibleQuiz.com! Stats from invitationals, tournaments, District Finals, Regional Finals, and National Finals are now available to view.

If you have more historical information to add, email [hello@biblequiz.com](mailto:hello@biblequiz.com).

## CoachApp

Built by a coach and developer, CoachApp makes it easy for coaches to keep score, lookup answers, research data, see the rules, and get the online schedule for any registered competition on BibleQuiz.com. [Free to download on the Apps page](https://biblequiz.com/apps/).
