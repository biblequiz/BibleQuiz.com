BibleQuiz.com has received a series of changes to better help coaches and coordinators prepare their teams for competition.

## JBQ Content
Junior Bible Quiz (JBQ) registration has been active for several years on BibleQuiz.com. Now we have added upcoming event information, live stats, and JBQ Nationals history ([going back to 2009]({{ site.url }}{% link _pages/jbq/2009/nationals.md %}).

## Upcoming Events

The [Registration site](https://registration.biblequiz.com) has been in use for years to help teams register and simplify collecting all the information for coordinators, including integrating with [ScoreKeep]({{ site.url }}{% link _pages/apps.md %}). With the latest changes, it's never been easier to find the stats and schedules for your events. Just visit the Upcoming and Live Event page for [JBQ]({{ site.url }}{% link _pages/upcoming-events/index.md %}) and [TBQ]({{ site.url }}{% link _pages/upcoming-events/tbq.md %}).

Coordinators can include their events by following [these instructions]({{ site.url }}{% link _pages/training/apps/index.md %}).
