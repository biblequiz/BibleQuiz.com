##### “A League” written by Kent Kloefkorn:

I believe memorization and quoting are essential, along with knowing your references & chapter analysis. I use a lot of Section Headings to direct you, and I also like multiple-part questions. A majority of my non-quoting questions require a “Complete Answer”, but just as important you should note on 20s & 30s when I do not use “Give a Complete Answer” and what that may signal. You'll find all ten-pointers straight-forward and easy, normally 7 words or less, at all levels of competition. League level questions will be very easy, most coming from one verse, and no change between league meets.

There will also be two Application questions per set from League Meet # 1 to League Meet #4. There will be no Application Questions in Meet # 5, District Finals, Regional Finals or National Finals.

District Final questions we will step up quotes and some questions to two and three verses, and we'll introduce some basic in-chapter cross-reference material. Regional Final questions we will start utilizing the more difficult question types. 20s will run the gambit, with some easy, medium and tough questions, while the 30s will see a big step-up in difficulty, including cross-reference material. National Final questions will find most 20s and all 30s challenging – testing your mastery of the material. However, please note that due to the length of this season's material, the level of difficulty in concordance work should be less compared to a season covering shorter "Epistle" material.

##### “Middle School” written by LaJoie Ward

Middle School Practice Questions (found on CD available from My Healthy Church) are a direct reflection of the questions that will be seen at League Matches. For new quizzers, learning the Middle School Study Questions (found on the Basic 5 CD) is a great place to start. These questions are sometimes slightly more complex and do not always have the shortest answers, but learning these questions will hopefully widen their ability to answer other questions as well.

10 pointers were made to be easy and interruptible, with key words coming early in the question. 10-point answers are usually 1-3 words, but may sometimes be up to 6 words. 30 pointers are meant to reward quizzers who are learning complete verses. The 20 pointers fall somewhere between and feature more two-part questions and answers than the 10-point questions.

Scripture text questions can almost always be interrupted before the "quote," but they are longer questions, so quizzers should be prepared to wait and listen for key words before interrupting.

##### “Acts Experience” written by LaJoie Ward & Bernie Elliot

Within the first 12 “Toss Up” Questions, 10 will be Middle School Study Questions (found on the Basic 5 CD) by LaJoie. Those 10 pointers were made to be easy and interruptible, with key words coming early in the question. The 20 pointers fall somewhere between and feature more two-part questions and answers than the 10-point questions. 30 pointers are meant to reward quizzers who are learning complete verses. Question number 13-20 will contain 2 Application Questions (Found on Study Guide CD). The rest of the questions will almost always be asked by Section Titles and will include several chapter analysis answers. There will be very few quotes, but those that are asked are from Primary Verses.

### COACHING FOR ACTS

Coaching over the long book of Acts is tough! Approach the season like a marathon – set a steady pace and try to maintain for the entire season. Memorization is key. Start early if possible – no later than mid-August, and approach the material by league segments, trying to have those chapters memorized by each league date. If a quizzer gets behind, always skip forward to the beginning of the next league material at the conclusion of a league meet. You can use the time up to Districts or even Regionals to catch up on any skipped chapters. Two items are key – (1) work on those references – even if it's just making sure you have every 5th verse's reference down solid, and (2) every memorized chapter must be quoted on a weekly basis – you don't want to lose it. Help your quizzers by keeping them accountable – make the time by phone if needed for them to quote new & review material to you each week. A great coach is patient and willing to sacrifice time to listen to a quizzer quote the Word – it will bless both you and your quizzer immensely.

Kent Kloefkorn has been involved for almost 42 years since starting as a quizzer at age 12. Kent is the official “A” writer for the Book of Acts. Jokes he uses as someone that quizzed way back in the day... “I want to rebut a rumor that's going around – yes, I quizzed my 7th grade year, but skipped my 8th grade year and started again as a Freshman. However, it was NOT because we were waiting on Moses to finish more material.”

“Quizzers today think highlighting takes a lot of time. But when I was a quizzer – well, you try highlighting on stone tablets.” “When I quizzed, the timekeeper was the toughest official's position – if it got cloudy there was no way to read the sundial.” “Yup, I remember the first time as a quizzer I had to adjust to a new Bible version. We went from Greek to the King James Version.”

### “OUT OF THE WRECK I RISE”

**Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? – Rom 8:35**

God does not keep His child immune from trouble; He promises, “I will be with him in trouble...”Psalm 91:15. It doesn't matter how real or intense the adversities may be; nothing can ever separate him from the relationship to God. “No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.” Rom 8:37. Paul was not referring here to imaginary things, but to things that are dangerously real. And he said we are “super-victors” in the midst of them, not because of our own ingenuity, nor because of our courage, but because none of them affects our essential relationship with God in Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for the Christian who doesn't have something in the circumstances of his life that he wishes was not there. “Shall tribulation...? Tribulation is never a grand, highly welcomed event; but whatever may be-whether exhausting, irritating, or simply causing some weakness – it is not able to “separate us from the love of Christ.” Never allow tribulations of the “cares of this world” to separate you from remembering that God loves you (Matthew 13:22) “Shall ...distress...?” Can God's love continue to hold fast,

even when everyone and everything around us seems to be saying that His love is a lie, and that there is no such thing as justice? “Shall...famine...?” Can we not only believe in the love of God but also be “more than conquerors.” even while we are being starved?

Either Jesus Christ is a deceiver, having deceived even Paul, or else some extraordinary thing happens to someone who holds on to love of God when the odds are totally against him. Logic is silenced in the face of each of these things which come against him. Only things can account for it-the love of God in Christ Jesus. “Out of the wreck I rise” every time.

_Oswald Chambers, “My Utmost for His Highest”_

### DAY OF PRAYER & FASTING

As you listen and look around there are tremendous challenges for many involved in the Bible Quiz ministry. What each one is facing seems overwhelming, but God..... There are many issues, such as physical challenges, loss of loved ones, loss of jobs, other family issues, etc, etc. But as the devotional above states God loves us. With that in mind we are calling for a day of Fasting & Prayer (You may want to do more) on Tuesday, June 16 for our Lord to draw us closer to him and see His hand work among many even this month. Pray also for a super National Finals. ... pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. If you would like send me your specific requests and I will pray over those requests each day, but especially that week and June 16. Send to [ElliotBQ@aol.com](mailto:ElliotBQ@aol.com)

    ## PASTOR BERNIE'S LAST WORD
    
    _**ARE YOU A SMART BIBLE QUIZ COACH?**_
    
    This quiz consists of four questions that tell you whether or not you are qualified to be a Bible Quiz coach. There is no need to cheat. The questions are not that difficult. You just need to think like a coach.
    
    _**1\. How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?**_
    
    Correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close the door. This question tests whether or not you are doing simple things in a complicated way.
    
    _**2\. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?**_
    
    Incorrect answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant, and close the door. Correct answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door. This question tests your foresight.
    
    _**3\. The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals attend except one. Which animal does not attend?**_
    
    Correct answer: The elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator! This tests if you are capable of comprehensive thinking.
    
    OK, if you did not answer the last three questions correctly, this one may be your last chance to test your qualifications to be a coach.
    
    _**4\. There is a river that is known to have many crocodiles in it. How do you cross it?**_
    
    Correct Answer: Simply swim through it. All the crocodiles are attending the animal meeting! This question tests your reasoning ability.

So... If you answered four out of four questions correctly, you are a true Bible Quiz coach. Success awaits you. If you answered three out of four, you have some catching up to do, but there's hope for you. If you answered two out of four, consider a career as a hamburger flipper in a fast food joint. If you answered one out of four, try selling some of your organs. It's the only way you will ever make any money. If you answered none correctly, consider a career that does not require any higher mental functions at all, such as politics. :)

It was great to connect with many of you recently over the four weekends of Regionals. Thank you for investing in our students!!! As I am getting ready to start my 39th year in this great ministry, I am excited for the upcoming season over the book of Acts. May God richly bless you for sharing the Word of God with your students.

Blessings,
